15_inch_main_armament_desc;The main armament of the first dreadnoughts consisted in most cases of 12-inch or 13.5-inch guns, but modern navies soon began to desire a larger calibre main armament. This resulted in later battleships being armed with 15-inch or 16-inch main guns, which had significantly greater destructive power and range than their predecessors.

abolish_serfdom_desc;The institution of serfdom -- unfree farm labour tied to the land of a local noble, effectively a form of feudal slavery -- had existed in various forms in Russia since the Kievan Rus of the 11th century. Throughout the ages the institution had undergone several reforms and changes, but the first steps toward a complete abolishment were taken only in the 1810s, when the institution was abolished in the Russian domains of Kurland, Estonia and Livonia. The institution was only abolished in all of Russia with the agrarian reform of 1861, during the reign of Tsar Alexander II, who at the time feared that the Russian peasantry might otherwise seek their liberation through outright revolution.

ACW_DESC;Civil war rages in North America as the Conferate States attempt to secede from the Union. The outcome is uncertain, but already this promises to be a new type of war as both sides have access to railroads, telegraphs, and repeating rifles. Meanwhile, in Europe, Great Britain is experimenting with the first iron-hulled steam-driven warship, a combination which promises to revolutionise the war at sea. World wide the industrial revolution is gathering speed as more and more nations start to industrialise. The times they are a-changing.

adolph_wagner;Adolph Wagner
adolph_wagner_desc;Although one of the more active members of Schmoller's Verein, Wagner actually supported Menger in the Methodenstreit. His work on public finance is what he is best known for in economics. Outside economics, he was a companion of Lassalle and Rodbertus - although not sharing wholly in their socialist ideals and of more conservative instincts in political matters, Wagner was a severe critic of unfettered capitalism and recommended state alleviation of the burden upon labor. He wrote Science of Finance Vol 1-4 (1877-1901), and Foundations of Political Economy (1876). 
adopt_die_stem_desc;Ons sal lewe, ons sal sterwe,\nOns vir jou, Suid-Afrika.'\n\n'Die Stem van Suid-Afrika', or 'The Call of South-Africa' in English, although it gained official status as South Africa's national anthem only in 1957 had, for a long time prior, been unofficially used in that capacity. Originally written as a poem by C.J. Langehoven in 1918, the piece had music composed for it in 1921 by Marthinus Lourens de Villiers. 'Die Stem' saw frequent use in the broadcasts of the African Broadcasting Company, which played it at the end of daily broadcasts, along with God Save the King. Adopt 'Die Stem', and let us give our young country a proper anthem!

advanced_battlecruisers;Advanced Battlecruisers
advanced_battlecruisers_desc;In the immediate aftermath of the First World War, many battlecruisers under construction were scrapped or converted to aircraft cruisers. Those battlecruisers that remained were refitted with improved main armament and enhanced armour protection.
advanced_battleships;Advanced Battleships
advanced_battleships_desc;The experiences of the First World War lead to a series of design improvements for battleships, including a more effective use of armour protection to defend against plunging fire, improved protection against torpedoes, the widespread use of oil-driven propulsion, and further refinements in armament and fire control. Though few battleships were constructed in the first years after the First World War, due to economic constraints and treaty limitations, existing battleships were refitted to incorporate these advances in design.
advanced_cruisers;Advanced Cruisers
advanced_cruisers_desc;By the early 1920s cruiser design focused on two main types: light cruisers, generally with 6-inch main armament, and heavy cruisers, generally with 8-inch main armament. Their primary roles were fleet support in combination with destroyers, defence of sea lanes, and raiding.
advanced_destroyers;Advanced Destroyers
advanced_destroyers_desc;The evolution of the submarine into a potent threat to warships and merchant ships alike resulted in the evolution of destroyers to assume the primary role for defending against them, as opposed to their former role of defending the main battle fleet from torpedo boats. Thus the first years after the First World War saw improvements in destroyer design that aimed to enhance their ability to find and sink submarines, such as the implementation and refinement of SONAR.
advanced_fire_control;Advanced Fire Control
advanced_fire_control_desc;Advances in main armament and warship construction resulted in capital ships with more and larger main guns, capable of firing shells over great distances. It became increasingly important to simultaneously develop advanced methods of measuring where shells landed and deriving from these observations accurate measurements of where the main guns should be aimed in order to achieve hits on enemy warships.

The territory was bought by the United States in 1867 at the price of 2.3 cents per acre. The Alaska purchase was widely derided in the American press of the day as 'Seward's Icebox' after then Secretary of State William H. Seward, at whose initiative the purchase was made.

augustin_cournot_desc;French philosopher, mathematician and economist, Augustin Cournot has been rightly hailed as one of the greatest of the Proto-Marginalists.  The unique insights of his major economics work, Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth (1838) were without parallel.  Although neglected in his time, the impact of Cournot work on modern economics can hardly be overstated.

austrian_form_south_german_confederation_desc;While Germany was not united until the proclamation of the German Empire, following the Franco-Prussian war, rising nationalism in the 19th century had meant that unification had been on the cards long before that, with the Frankfurt assembly of 1848 being an important forerunner. By achieving a dominant position among the South German states, we can form the South German Confederation.

autarky;Autarky
autarky_desc;Derived from the Ancient Greek for self-sufficiency, in the early twentieth century autarky was the goal for many States that felt further dependence upon the global economy was a threat to their national independence or the ideological basis of their regimes. In order to achieve autarky, such states would impose huge tariff barriers to imports from overseas, encourage the development of local industries to produce goods previously imported, strictly regulate foreign trade to preserve national income, and investigate the development of alternative substitutes to critical raw materials that were not available to the nation except from the world market. As an economic policy autarky could be called a twentieth-century revision of mercantilism, and while most often used by Communist and Fascist regimes that rejected all or part the capitalist model of economic production, even capitalist nations would resort to elements of autarky in times of economic instability, especially if they controlled large overseas empires that could provide key raw materials.

bruno_hildebrand_desc;Highly critical of Classical theory, Hildebrand spent much of his time attacking Ricardo relentlessly for being materialistic, universalistic and cosmopolitan. Only later in his life did he put his own idea down - in particular, developing a linear 'stages' theory of economic history. His empirical and statistical work, however, did not make much use of these insights.

buying_on_margin;Buying on Margin
buying_on_margin_desc;As more individuals became involved in investing in securities markets in the early twentieth century, the practice of buying on margin developed to increase the amount of shares that could be bought with minimal initial overhead. The principal of buying on margin is that if the investment makes a profit, the profit would cover the cost of the commission charged for allowing the purchase of large amounts of securities with only a minimal initial investment. The risk involved in this type of investment is that if the investment shows a loss, the difference between the initial investment and the commission charged for the purchase must be made up by the investor. How low an initial margin was prudent for the securities industry to accept would be the subject of intense debate, as lower margins both allowed investors with limited capital to invest in markets, but raised the risk of default by these limited-capital investors should the investments fail to produce profits

carl_menger;Carl Menger
carl_menger_desc;Carl Menger has been hailed as one of the three leaders of the 'Marginalist Revolution' of the 1870s, along with William Stanley Jevons and Leon Walras. However, Menger's Grundsetze (Principles), published in 1871, eschewed all the mathematical scaffolding that characterized the works of the other two revolutionaries. As such, many economists have insisted that Menger should be placed apart. In one sense, he can be considered different. Unlike Jevons or Walras, Carl Menger founded a proper 'school of thought' which has more-or-less retained its distinctive character since - namely, the Austrian School. His two disciples at Vienna, Eugen von Behm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser did much to advance and forge that school.

centralized_economic_planning;Centralized Economic Planning
centralized_economic_planning_desc;As more radical ideological alternatives to liberal democracy gained power in the early twentieth century, the opportunity to reconstruct economic organization based on State direction of economic activity that could be compared to the relative success or failure of traditional market-based economic structures arose. Such programs of centralized economic planning, employed by both communist and fascist regimes, often achieved dramatic initial results in reducing unemployment, increasing output of industrial goods, and removing the problem of conflict between laborer and employer in society, which the regimes would trumpet as proof of the superiority of their systems over free market systems. The social and economic costs to these societies, however, were often very high, and the resistance to State control created the potential for brutal repression. However, to the outside world that new little of the negative consequences of these plans, they seemed to suggest a viable alternative to the free-market systems that had been the hallmark of nineteenth century economic theory.

clear_out_the_manchu_elite_desc;Since the beginning of the Qing dynasty, the Chinese Imperial administration and bureaucracy had been dominated by a powerful Manchu elite, and the Qing emperors had traditionally discriminated heavily against ethnic Han. In the 1860s, Empress Dowager Cixi effectively ended this practice, when she entrusted the country's most powerful military unit to a man of Han background, Zeng Guofan, during the suppression of the Taiping rebellion. By getting rid of the Manchu elite, we can take an important step toward modernization.

combined_arms_planning_desc;In the aftermath of the First World War, the major powers put an increasing emphasis on what came to be known as combined operations. This represented the utilization of land, sea, and air forces together to achieve a single strategic objective. Often revolving around amphibious operations, combined operations often fit within larger naval strategic objectives, including the destruction of enemy naval assets and the securing of sealanes. No longer could navies operate in isolation from the other branches of the military, and the development of new tactics was required to integrate naval warfare into the larger strategic perspective.

The first cuirassiers were produced as a result of armoured cavalry, such as the man-at-arms and demi-lancer, discarding their lances and adopting the use of pistols as their primary weapon. They achieved increased prominence during the Napoleonic Wars and were last fielded in the opening stages of World War I. Cuirassiers continue to be employed as ceremonial troops by a number of countries.

danmarks_riges_grundlov_desc;Denmark had been an absolute monarchy since 1660 when, on June fifth 1849, King Frederick VII signed the document known as 'Danmarks Riges Grundlov', The Danish Constitution, into law. The signing of a constitution delimiting the monarch's power, a development which Fredericks predecessors had fought hard to avoid, came about during a period of Danish national unity, following the First Schleswig War. The constitution marks Denmark's transition away from absolutism, and to a constitutional monarchy. Let us give our people a constitution!

The result of these efforts was the publication of the 'Zivilgesetzbuch', The Book of Civil Law, in 1847, which effectively united all territories of the Duchy under one common source of law.

During the Napoleonic wars, Prussia ceded Neuchetel after the country's defeat at the hands of Napoleon. After the Napoleonic wars, Neuchetel was joined with Switzerland as the 21st canton thereof, at the suggestion of Frederick William III of Prussia, while at the same time also remaining a Prussian principality pro forma. In 1848, the province shook off its monarchical past, and was declared a republic within the Swiss Confederation. The Prussian claims were equitably relinquished in 1857.

In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the 'Fatherland to remain calm', for, as the poem says, 'fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine', implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all (French) aggression. The poem was put to music in 1854, and became extremely popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.

eduard_bernstein_desc;Eduard Bernstein was originally a staunch disciple of Marx and started his life in the German Socialdemocratic Party, but during his later exile in London Bernstein gradually became convinced that the best way to obtain socialism in an industrialized country was through trade union activity and parliamentary politics. He published a series of articles where he argued that the predictions made by Karl Marx about the development of capitalism had not come true. He pointed out that the real wages of workers had risen and the polarization of classes between an oppressed proletariat and capitalists, had not materialized. Nor had capital become concentrated in fewer hands. Bernstein's revisionist views appeared in his extremely influential book Evolutionary Socialism (1899).

enact_female_suffrage_desc;The idea of Woman's Suffrage increasingly gained traction in Western society throughout the 19th century.

The experience during The First World War, of women working in factories, and other jobs previously reserved for men during peacetime, is often said to have been a crucial pivot point in securing Woman's right to work, vote, and, in other fields of society, achieve legal equality with men.

enact_muhammad_alis_reforms_desc;Muhammad Ali, an Albanian born in Macedonia during Ottoman rule there, served in the Kavala Volunteer Contingent of the Ottoman Army in Egypt during the first years of the 19th century. Following the withdrawal of Napoleon's armies from Egypt Muhammad, through a long series of political maneuvering, came to be elected Wali (governor) of Ottoman Egypt, a position he would eventually use to secure Egypt as his own personal domain as Mamluk power waned. During his reign he instituted a series of more or less popular, and more or less successful, reforms, all aiming to transform Egypt into a modern, european-style, state. Among other things he constructed a shipyard in Alexandria, brought much of Egypt's farmland under direct state control, and sent missions to Europe to collect and bring western knowledge and technology to Egypt. By instituting these reforms, we can take Egypt a small step closer to modernization.

eugen_von_behm_bawerk;Eugen von Behm-Bawerk
eugen_von_behm_bawerk_desc;Behm-Bawerk's career as a scholar was an intermittent one. The most significant span of scholarly activity was his years at the University of Innsbruck (1881-1889). It was during the 1880s that he first published two of the three volumes of his magnum opus, Capital and Interest. His later years were dominated by his duties as the Austrian Minister of Finance, a position he held, though not continuously, throughout the 1890s and beyond-and for which he is fittingly honored by having his likeness on Austria's one-hundred schilling note. After serving in this capacity and assuming other governmental duties, he returned to teaching in 1904. With a chair at the University of Vienna, he became a colleague of Wieser, successor to the retired Menger. Students who passed through the university during the last decade of Behm-Bawerk's career (and life: he died in 1914) included Joseph Schumpeter and Ludwig von Mises.

EVERYDAY_NEEDS;Everyday Needs
EVTDESC100;With the ravages of alcohol taking a daily toll on our people, tearing away, every day with newfound intensity, at the moral and spiritual fabric of our national character, it becomes imperative for us to bond together in defense of public virtue, and to educate and uplift the poor and the downtrodden to the virtues of temperance.'\n\nFor quite some time now, our country has been dealing with increases in the consumption of alcohol. Readily available, and cheap, distilled spirits, in combination with hard working conditions, make the poorer classes especially susceptible to this deadly poison. It comes as no surprise that a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Temperance League has been formed
EVTDESC1000;Karl Marx has published The Communist Manifesto, which has led to workers in $COUNTRY$ to found a party dedicated to advancing the agenda laid out therein. They call themselves socialists and believe in a land ruled by the workers, where the workers control the means of production. Equality, justice, solidarity and democracy are other vital points in the socialists ideology.
EVTDESC10000;The relative quiet of the early 19th century was broken with a crashing revelry in $YEAR$, as liberal agitation erupted into open revolution across the continent. The Monarchical Ancien Regimes of Europe could only look on in horror and disgust, as the hymns of the French revolution could again be heard echoing from Europe's tumultuous streets, and student's and youth again gathered under republican tricolors, celebrating the ideals, dreams and wishes of a young generation, animated by the powerful message of human liberty -- in economic, cultural, social and national affairs -- that was European Liberalism.
EVTDESC10001;While Napoleon and his armies has been defeated, the fundamental ideas of the French Revolution have not been. In Germany the old crowns of the Holy Roman Empire have been wrought to naught, and the feudal contracts of old replaced by Napoleonic civil codes. Everywhere in Europe, in coffeehouses and universities, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters, are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles on Waterloo, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.
EVTDESC1001;We want, no, we NEED a free society, where no one is considered to be superior, no one is left behind and where mankind is free from oppression and scarcity. We need a society without a government, without class divisions and where the workers control the means of production.'
EVTDESC1003;Strength through Unity! The government has grown weak, we need a party who can unite us, who can give us a strong national identity and who will not be fooled by capitalism's sweet but poisonous voice.' The Third Way, or fascists as they might be called, are looking to get a seat in the Upper House.
EVTDESC10050;Broken, busted and thrown to the sides lie the barricades, and the tricolors have stopped waving from the window sills. The events that will be recorded by history as the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Liberal Revolution of $YEAR$ are all in the past, and it seems that we have managed to weather the storm.
EVTDESC10100;Phytophthora infestans, the dreaded potato blight, has struck $PROVINCENAME$. Starving local smallholders, and in some places driving whole families from their homes, the potato blight has caused a localized famine that threatens to spread.
EVTDESC10105;And while our people still labor under ghastly conditions in the fields, what has our government done to relieve the starving farmers affected this very year by the dreaded Potato blight? Economic freedom could allow for the import of ersatz foodstuffs, but privileges long established must, apparently, be maintained.'\n\nLiberal sympathizers have come out of the woodwork both locally and in parliament, criticizing our government for its inability to handle the Potato Blight that recently struck one of our provinces. If the liberals become too strong, they may very well conspire again to ferment revolution. We should also consider dispatching troops to provinces where we see Liberal Agitation.
EVTDESC10110;Fast and true stands the guard in $CAPITAL$, at least if a local poet is to be believed. A poetical pamphlet decrying the state of our nation, its political backwardness and oppression, has inflamed feelings in one of our states. All around $COUNTRY$ cries for national unity can be heard, as liberals take to the streets protesting the old order, calling for national unification with our cultural brethren in other countries, and a liberalization of our political system. We should consider dispatching troops to provinces where Liberal Agitation is present.
EVTDESC10120;A new daily has begun circulating in $PROVINCENAME$. The $PROVINCENAME$ Herald, carrying hard-hitting political commentary, literary critique and local news, has quickly developed into a flagship for local liberal politics.
EVTDESC10130;A local chapter of the Chartist Society, calling for a broadening of the voting franchise, and an end to landed voting rights, has opened in $PROVINCENAME$.
EVTDESC10140;Liberal causes have started to gain traction in $PROVINCENAME$. While no one knows for sure, rumor has it that the root cause of this sudden upswing in liberal propaganda efforts is the recent foundation of a secret society. Whether it be Rosicrucians, Freemasons or The Bavarian Illuminati, someone is spreading liberal ideas in $PROVINCENAME$.
EVTDESC10150;The smog from the factories hangs low against the blood red of a charcoal sky. Far away in the depths of the city, in the deepest bowels of the industrial machine, the cries and shouts of a forming mob can be heard echoing against a backdrop of drainpipes and smokestacks. Infuriated over poor working conditions, clamoring for a return to a lost pastoral dream remembered, Luddites take to the streets in $PROVINCENAME$.
EVTDESC10160;Immorality is like water, flowing through every conceivable crack in the dams of legal authority. The liberals in $PROVINCENAME$ have, on account of the ban on public meetings, begun holding banquets. Ostensibly without purpose -- A gathering among friends, a celebration, a feast -- the common knowledge secret that no one dare pronounce is that these banquets are political meetings carried out behind a thin veneer of legality.
EVTDESC10170;Like rats carrying contagious diseases, the preachers of modernity move effortlessly back and forth across our borders. Liberal agitation has spread to $PROVINCENAME$ from a neighboring province. We might want to send some troops here.
EVTDESC10180;In a time when the forces of revolution threaten to overthrow all the long-established orders of Europe, it becomes our sacred duty to voice our dissent. The Jacobins -- holding nothing sacred save the profane -- are charlatans peddling false ideologies. What Robespierre's terror brought to France, their radicalism now threatens to impose on $COUNTRY$.'\n\nThe widespread liberal agitation in $COUNTRY$ has mobilized the forces of reaction, and a leading conservative intellectual has published an Anti-Jacobin tract.
EVTDESC10190;And let it be known, that those who argue the cause of revolution argue against the cause and design of almighty God himself. For he, in his wisdom, has made kingdoms on earth, and set kings to rule over them.'\n\nA local preacher in $PROVINCENAME$ has held a fiery sermon condemning several liberal causes.
EVTDESC10200;Death to the King!', a hoarse voice cries. The streets in $PROVINCENAME$ have come alive. A local injustice, or the perception of one, have animated the unwashed masses into rebellion against our rule. The revolt is still small enough that its future course has not been set in stone, and leniency might avert it, but perhaps it is best to put our foot down firmly to set an example?
EVTDESC10210;The revolutionary flames in $COUNTRY$ are fanned, as $PROVINCENAME$ erupts into open rebellion. Crying out for liberty, justice and equality, the citizens take to the streets.
EVTDESC10220;The sound of rain falling on the deserted square is deafening. A tattered pamphlet, thrown in the gutter -- the ink running out across the paper in soft blueish blooms -- is the only thing that still serves as proof that $PROVINCENAME$ was, up until just recently, a hot-bed of liberal agitation. Depicted on the pamphlet is a Sans-culotte, the iconographic personification of the French revolution, holding a republican tricolor. The pamphlet reads: 'Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood -- $COUNTRY$'. It is soon swept away by the rain and down into the sewers whence it came.
EVTDESC10230;The defining symptom of Cholera is an exhaustive diarrhea, rendering the diseased almost completely incapable of retaining fluid. In severe forms, the disease can cause death within a few days of the first symptoms, making it one of the most rapidly fatal illnesses know to man. Today we received a dispatch from one of our provinces, confirming earlier reports that the disease has, indeed, broken out there.
EVTDESC10240;One minute he's walking and talking normally, and the next he clutches his stomach, dashing in the general direction of the outhouse. There's really only one explanation.
EVTDESC10250;Our peasants and workers live in squalid huts whose only virtue is that they are easy to burn down! Unsanitary conditions, the norm for the common man in $COUNTRY$, abound, and still it comes as a surprise to our government that Cholera has now broken out in $PROVINCENAME$?'\n\nThe cholera epidemic in $PROVINCENAME$ has become politics, as liberals exploit the outbreak in an attack on our government.
EVTDESC10260;The presence of a sizable army contingent in $PROVINCENAME$ has caused liberal agitation and revolutionary talk, which could just up until now be heard on almost every street corner, to die down.
EVTDESC10270;That we, the youth of $COUNTRY$, unite in our common demand for the restoration of ancient freedoms. To make, in $COUNTRY$, a second Greece.'\n\nA student's association, inspired by ancient, romanticist ideas of freedom and the state, has been formed by radical youth at the state University. A manifesto has been published, calling for voting reform and a revival of what is referred to as 'Those ancient and traditional liberties of $COUNTRY$'. The association is quickly becoming something of a mass movement on the campus, as this brave new ideology surges.
EVTDESC10280;And, when I read of the Athens of Pericles, the progressiveness of these ancient societies always astounds me. Here I am, thousands of years later, a less free man than were they, back then.'\n\nThe 19th century saw a resurgence of interest in the Ancient Classics. Many of the ancient societies, Rome and Greece, were looked to for inspiration by liberal thinkers seeing in them proto examples and experiments in those same traditions of freedom that they sought to implement in the modern era. A local Reform Club has republished some select pieces of ancient literature that are becoming high fashion among the educated elites of $COUNTRY$
EVTDESC10290;And yet he saw the privations of a people denied that ancient breath of fresh air accorded by tradition as the birthright of the free sons of $COUNTRY$, liberty, and he wept.'\n\nOne of our country's most lauded authors has published a book recently, which critics have referred to as the most scathing condemnation of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system ever to make it past censors. The author's work is a passionate argument for liberty and the disestablishment of the established monarchical order of the old world, in favor of the rights of peoples and republics.
EVTDESC10300;The chamber of commerce in one of our states has lodged an angry protest with local government, complaining that the government's economic policy of economic interventionism harms local business by distorting the fundamental logic of the free market. Inspired by enlightenment publications on free trade and laissez faire by the French Physiocrats and the Scottish enlightenment, the Chamber of Commerce demands that the government's policy change, and that they be left alone to conduct business in the manners which they see fit. If their demands are not met, they threaten to raise the issue to the national level.
EVTDESC10320;A Liberal professor at one of our universities has published a pamphlet on economics that has received serious attention in liberal circles both in $COUNTRY$ and abroad. The pamphlet is a profound little tract, arguing in eloquent terms the virtues of freemarketeering and laissez faire, and the author is now being mentioned in the same breath as luminaires such as Ricardo and Smith. We could decry the pamphlet as a spurious piece of liberal propaganda, but, then again, he might have a point?
EVTDESC10330;A rally has been organized in one of our states by members of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Chartist Club, calling for the extension of the voting privileges to broader strata of the voting publicum. While calm and relatively orderly on the surface, the rally might get out of hand at any time. Police are standing by, ready to intervene, and some among them even seem eager to.
EVTDESC110;Another Beer Hall has opened in one of our provinces today, adding yet another notch to the province's reputation as a paradise for ramblers, gamblers and drunkards alike. For every hundred citizens in the province there is now a saloon, brothel, beer hall or other institution of vice and sin. While spirits may serve to raise even the bleakest of moods, the long term effects of overconsumption are not to be trifled with.
EVTDESC1100;A dried up old traveller has returned from the wilderness. When given a whiskey he says with a hoarse voice 'Gold! I have found Gold! A mountain of Gold!'
EVTDESC1105;A dried up old traveller has returned from the wilderness. When given a whiskey he says with a hoarse voice 'Diamonds! I have found Diamonds! A mountain of Diamonds!'
EVTDESC1107;A small expedition that was sent to investigate $PROVINCENAME$ and its surroundings has made some quite interesting discoveries. According to the explorers, rubber trees are growing in abundance in the area. Their discovery could prove quite useful within the near future.
EVTDESC1109;A dried up old traveller has returned from the wilderness. When given a whiskey he says with a hoarse voice 'Oil! I have found Oil! An ocean of Oil!'
EVTDESC11100;A rising tide of liberal nationalism within greater $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ has toppled the government in $FROMCOUNTRY$. A parliament of liberal revolutionaries has been convened, with representatives from all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, which has decreed that the time is right for the nation to unite under one banner. The parliament has offered the crown of this united $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ to us. We could accept the offer, but doing so would cause international alarm, and require us to compensate the revolutionaries politically.
EVTDESC11101;$MONARCHTITLE$, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador has presented us with news from the $UNION_ADJ$ Congress. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has accepted the $UNION_ADJ$ crown, and proclaimed themselves the one true $UNION_ADJ$ nation. These winds of change will be hard to resist.
EVTDESC111011928;Through warfare and diplomacy an Arabian union has been created. Shall we join it?
EVTDESC11102;All around $COUNTRY$, jubilant crowds, waving the flag of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, take to the streets in celebration, as the government in $CAPITAL$ has proclaimed the unification of all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag.\n\n'For far too long have we let the machination and conspiracy of foreign powers set the course of our nation's life. Today, and forever -- here, in our ancient homeland -- we form the bonds of a more perfect union. Three Hurrahs for $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$!'\n\n
EVTDESC11103;$MONARCHTITLE$! News have just reached us that renowned Italian freedom fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi and his 'Expedition of The Thousand' have broken and taken control of the government in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Everywhere this rugged freedom fighter goes jubilant crowds of Italians turn out to greet him -- waving the tricolor of the Italian nation -- as the liberator of all of Italy. On account of our dominant position on the peninsula, the newly formed government in $FROMCOUNTRY$ sends word that they accept $COUNTRY$'s natural position as the foremost among equals of the newly formed Italy.
EVTDESC1139;For a long time, rumors have circulated among natives of a mythical place on the highveld where gold nuggets the size of apples lie scattered openly on the ground. Whether the legend was originally a figment of fact or fiction, it was confirmed today, when prospectors in the Witwatersrand struck a motherlode of gold. News of the gold rush are spreading throughout the world like wildfire, and a new town has been incorporated in the province to deal with this new influx of fortune seekers and Uitlanders. The province will henceforth be known, simply, as 'Johannesburg'.
EVTDESC1140;Lt. Colonel Custer reports back from the Black Hills with an announcement that gold in substantial quantities has been discovered in the Dakota territory. Prospectors, miners and fortune-seekers flock to the area, but troubling reports tell of strange howls and cries coming from the hills at night. Some say that the Sioux are going on the warpath...
EVTDESC120;A police raid against a $PROVINCENAME$ bar tonight has provoked a massive public backlash against police and other authorities. Locals, infuriated over the police's decision to close the bar, further aggravated by an already liberal intake of alcohol, have taken to the streets in what can best be described as a drunken rampage through the city.
EVTDESC1200;Less money for crime fighting results in lowered ability to respond to security threats like anarchist uprisings.
EVTDESC12000;The black smoke pouring out from the pit, in long, drawn out billows, reeks of coal and fire, and the intensity of the smell almost drowns out an undertone of burnt flesh. A hurried commotion breaks out as the survivors of a The Great Explosion of $YEAR$ scurry to save what is left of the coal mine. The seams in the coalfield lie, sleeping for centuries, embedded in pockets of methane. A carelessly lit lantern, a spark from a pick striking rock, and a sea of hellfire.
EVTDESC1201;Less money for crime fighting results in lowered ability to respond to security threats like battling street gangs.
EVTDESC12010;The general findings of our commission are, therefore, these: Working conditions in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coal fields fail to reach even the basest modicums of decency with regards to safety. The mines rely heavily on child labour for several of the more dangerous and filthy jobs -- the youngest employee being a boy a mere nine years of age -- lighting is poor and ventilation scant, in an environment that is pitch black with coal dust. Furthermore...'\n\nThe Mines & Fields Commission of $YEAR$ has submitted its final report on working conditions in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coal fields, and the verdict is harsh.
EVTDESC1202;With rising crime rates and less government control, businessmen would become more and more centered on their own profits. This results in a higher risk of collapse for the entire system, as everybody strives for personal interests.
EVTDESC12020;The coal laden tub must have weighed heavily on her body, fragile and worn from many years of arduous labour in the $PROVINCENAME$ coal pits, for her feet could no longer carry her. There, in the dark, where the shafts go countless fathoms deep, she slipped and fell.'\n\nAnother young girl has lost her life in a coal mining accident in one of our provinces, and the particular tragedy of the case has received national attention.
EVTDESC1203;The system of machine politics was in essence the bribery of mainly minorities by politicians using their influence. It was common to use the appointment for government jobs as a means of bribery within this system.
EVTDESC12030;One of our munitions factories has experienced a severe shortfall in production over the past three months, which has gone unreported for fear of causing alarm among investors and local industrial magnates. By covering the factory's losses with materials from the national stockpile, we could be perceived as saving local jobs.
EVTDESC1204;If the crime fighting institutions in a province become overstretched, organized crime in form of a mafia would develop. Such organizations resulted in lowered productivity in the province.
EVTDESC12040;Locals in $PROVINCENAME$ are complaining about certain emissions coming from the local fertilizer factory. While the place might smell like roses to the provincial budget, the balance certainly hasn't been adding up for local noses lately. We could support an ordinance to modify the work process, but doing so might anger local captains of industry.
EVTDESC1205;The system of rotten boroughs was a system to create such small voting districts that a certain victory could be won through plain bribery.
EVTDESC12050;The central Tea Weighing Station in the tea producing $PROVINCENAME$ province has been held up by armed thugs. Some locals speculate that harsh times in the province might have provoked local farmers, tired of seeing local distributors and retailers eating away at their profits, to rob the station. Whatever the cause may be, we need to address the situation.
EVTDESC1206;Lacking sufficient control institutions, politicians would eventually use their power and influence for their personal wealth and glory. This results in increased militancy of the whole population in the province.
EVTDESC12060;While the war rages, every can that rolls off the production line from '$PROVINCENAME$ Canned Food & Preservatives Ltd.' is as important as a cannonball or a rifle. The food is reportedly excellent, and very popular among our soldiers. So popular, in fact, that the General Staff has commissioned another massive order from the factory.
EVTDESC1207;With less security personnel around in the province, terrorists have an easier time hiding and waiting for opportunities to strike.
EVTDESC12070;The Quartermaster General reports the discovery of a forgotten cache of canned foodstuffs in an army stockpile in $PROVINCENAME$. The content of the cans is still, despite being several years old, apparently quite edible. What should we do with the 15 tonnes of canned food?
EVTDESC1208;Less government investment into crime fighting results in a very unfair distribution of the wealth in a province. The rich would get even richer, while the poor would get poorer.
EVTDESC12080;A strange fever has erupted among the cattle in $PROVINCENAME$, and the cattle are reported dying en masse. The veterinarian at the local garrison has been criss-crossing the province trying to what little can be done to stave off the effects of this, apparently quite contagious, disease. While the disease itself will eventually dissipate, the question of reimbursement for hundreds of ruined farmers and their families still requires attention.
EVTDESC1209;By investing more money in crime fighting we have increased our ability to respond to security threats like anarchist uprisings.
EVTDESC12090;The cocoons shrivel and die, and what little thread there is on them fails to coagulate properly, and unravels at the slightest breeze. Something is awry in the silk fields, and even our best chemists have not been able to find a cure for the disease that plagues our farms. Local silk farmers are outraged, and call upon the government to act.
EVTDESC1210;By investing more money in crime fighting we have increased our ability to respond to security threats like battling street gangs.
EVTDESC12100;A chemist of no small renown has invented a cure for the disease that has been plaguing our silk farms in $PROVINCENAME$, and, even better, with government support the cure could be exported to all our provinces, should more of them be affected by this nasty illness.
EVTDESC1211;By investing more money in crime fighting we have managed to increase government control and decrease crime rates. Businessmen are becoming less and less centered on their own profits, and the risk of the system collapsing has decreased considerably, as fewer are striving for personal interests.
EVTDESC12110;The cotton produced in $PROVINCENAME$ is of the highest possible quality and strength. So strong, in fact, is the $PROVINCENAME$ cotton, that the white balls harvested there have begun building quite a reputation for themselves as being some of the best available in the world. The reputation has built for quite some time, and local farmers have begun taking pride in the fact that, in the world of cotton, $PROVINCENAME$ is a byword for quality.
EVTDESC1212;By investing more money in crime fighting we have increased our ability to respond to machine politics. Machine Politics is in essence the bribery of mainly minorities by politicians using their influence. It was common to use the appointment for government jobs as a means of bribery within this system.
EVTDESC12120;Not by speeches and votes of the majority, are the great questions of the time decided, but by iron and blood.'\n-Otto von Bismarck\n\nA new, rich lode of iron ore has been discovered in the $PROVINCENAME$ mine. While the ore is rich, it is also located on a perilous depth that is just beyond the reach of our present mining technology. We could attempt to extract the ore, but doing so will carry with it a cost in lives and blood.
EVTDESC1213;By investing more money in crime fighting we have increased our ability to respond to organized crime, such as the mafia. These kinds of organizations would otherwise result in lowered productivity in the province.
EVTDESC1214;The idea behind the rotten boroughs was to create such small voting districts that a certain victory could be won through plain bribery. By investing more money in crime fighting we have managed to deal with the over-representation of boroughs with a small number of electors.
EVTDESC12140;The wharfs, quays, and drydocks in $PROVINCENAME$ are abuzz with the rings of hammers and the songs of saws, as the local factory struggles to keep up with new orders for clipper ships that are pouring in from all over the world. Efficient work processes and management, combined with excellent craftsmanship and seamanship, have led $PROVINCENAME$ to produce more and better ships than during any year previous! Perhaps this is the time to rest on the laurels, but, then again, the future is always an uncertainty.
EVTDESC1215;By investing more money in crime fighting we have been able to increase the number of control institutions, and thereby made it harder for politicians to use their power and influence for their personal wealth and glory. The militancy among the people in $PROVINCENAME$ should no longer increase so dramatically
EVTDESC12150;Tragedy struck $PROVINCENAME$ today, when a steam boiler exploded during a routine test in the machine shop contracted to build it for the local steamer factory. Seven workers were killed in the explosion, and several thousands of pounds worth of equipment were destroyed. Local officials are investigating the working conditions in the shop, and hopefully these accidents can be avoided in the future, but, for now, $PROVINCENAME$ mourns her dead.
EVTDESC1216;With an increased number of security personnel in $PROVINCENAME$, terrorists won't find as many opportunities to strike and will also have a harder time hiding.
EVTDESC12160;$PROVINCENAME$ has been making quite a name for itself in the cement industry over the past few years. What started out as smalltime production in a family business has now grown to an industry big enough to support the entire province, and the name 'Standard $PROVINCENAME$ Cement' is becoming a household name. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ cement recipes from $PROVINCENAME$ are being admired and imitated across the world!
EVTDESC1217;By increasing the amount of government investments into crime fighting we have managed to distribute the wealth in $PROVINCENAME$ more evenly. The gap between rich and poor is no longer as dramatic as it was some time ago.
EVTDESC12170;Several workers dyed today at the $PROVINCENAME$ dyeworks, when an industrial sized tub of hot dye accidentally spilled out over the workshop floor, and the unsuspecting workers. Locals are upset about the incident, claiming that the poor safety regulations in the hot and dangerous workplace are to blame for the accident, and are urging the government to take action. As rescue workers left the scene, several workshop employees were left dyeing.
EVTDESC12180;A fuel cistern at the $PROVINCENAME$ refinery exploded today for reasons yet unknown, and the lives of seven workers were claimed in the ensuing conflagration, along with thousands of dollars worth in company property. The refinery owner has washed his hands of any responsibility for the accident, claiming instead that government safety inspections have been lacking.
EVTDESC12190;The $PROVINCENAME$ refinery has been doing well lately, with production exceeding expected quotas by several thousand gallons. Due to storage problems, the refinery owner has approached the government with a deal to buy the fuel at a steep discount. We could either buy the fuel ourselves, or turn him down and wait for him to float the cheap fuel on the market. The local impact of cheap fuel should make the locals fairly happy, but we could probably use the fuel ourselves.
EVTDESC12200;Another tragic day for our labourers today, as an accident was reported as having claimed several lives in the $PROVINCENAME$ iron mine. Several workers have been reported injured, and some are still missing. A faulty support beam in the mine collapsed to cause the accident, reports from $PROVINCENAME$ say. The incident is bound to raise at least a local debate on working conditions in our mines.
EVTDESC12210;A fisherman off the $PROVINCENAME$ coast has brought in an enormous catch today. His trawler is practically teeming with the riches of the richest of oceans as he anchors in the harbor, and fairly soon other fishermen are able to repeat his example. The fishing is unusually good in $PROVINCENAME$ this year, it seems.
EVTDESC12220;The tea harvest is unusually large this year, and nowhere is it larger than in $PROVINCENAME$. Everywhere one ventures in the area, sacks and sacks again stand lined up, brimming with freshly picked leaves of wonderfully smelling tea. This harvest will probably set us straight for years if we're capable of leveraging it right. Should we let the farmers keep an extra portion of the harvest, let our merchants sell it for profit, or should we stockpile it for later use?
EVTDESC12230;A local radio station in $PROVINCENAME$ is facing a shortage of radio components for their transmitters, and have been forced to cease brodcasts until the situation is resolved. Local authorities have suggested lending some of the government's radio components to the station, as it fears that the local populace will be alarmed by a lack of news from the front.
EVTDESC12240;More and more social, religious and educational institutions in $COUNTRY$, primarily from the educated middle classes, are coming to see the influence of alcohol on our society as a moral and social wrong. Pointing at the effects and costs in terms of broken homes, windows and spirits, they urge temperance, with some even going so far as to support calls for outright prohibition. Brewery owners in $PROVINCENAME$ are concerned by the development, and wish to see their future privilege to sell and manufacture alcohol guaranteed.
EVTDESC12250;A fire at a $PROVINCENAME$ Explosives Warehouse has caused a massive blast that some say could be heard all the way to $CAPITAL$. The devastation is massive, and hundreds of lives in the vicinity are reported lost. As the fire spreads through the city, the fire department needs to prioritize: The fire threatens to spread north to the affluent $PROVINCENAME$ neighborhoods, and south to poorer areas. Where to?
EVTDESC12260;Mayhaps this chair, madame? Made from the finest Brazilian Mahogany, inlaid with delicate Nubian patterns of Kenyan ivory. Observe the rich marbling on the leather. You won't find another one like it in all of $PROVINCENAME$!'\n\nRising standards of living in $PROVINCENAME$ have caused an upswing in the demand for better and more elegant furniture. As people's homes are beautified, it only makes sense that the offices of government are, likewise, upgraded to better conform to modern standards.
EVTDESC12270;Disaster has struck our luxury clothes factory in $PROVINCENAME$, where several shipments have been cancelled over the past few weeks. The reason for the cancellations seems to be that the clothes, quite simply, aren't selling all that well, and no wonder, the cut is wrong, and the buttons look almost clownishly large. Strange, they seemed so nice last season.
EVTDESC12280;Water has seeped into a factory warehouse in $PROVINCENAME$, damaging several shipping crates' worth of clothing. The clothing has been infected by a pungent smelling mold of some kind, and while it doesn't look so bad, the fiber in the cloth reeks of cellar and stale water. We might be able to salvage the clothes, but there is some doubt as to whether anyone would want to use them.
EVTDESC130;Destitution and poverty, along with the other social ills that follow in the wake of a serious alcohol addiction, are becoming ever more widespread in $PROVINCENAME$ and in the entire $STATENAME$ region. Local temperance advocates blame the multitude of venues, bars and beer halls available in $PROVINCENAME$, while other, perhaps less partisan, observers point to unemployment and hard working conditions as determinant factors behind the epidemic.
EVTDESC13000;Once the wind of Western civilization blows to the East, every blade of grass and every tree in the East follow what the Western wind brings.'\n\nWe call them omens, the strange things that have transpired lately. Off our coastlines, strange ships have begun appearing. Strange ships, with masts so tall as to seem to touch the face of God. At first a curiosity, soon every so often -- increasing in intensity as gale grows to storm -- and tomorrow? Strange are their ships, and stranger still their customs, but there can be no doubt that we must adopt a policy with regards to the foreigners from 'Europe'.
EVTDESC13010;News reaches us from $PROVINCENAME$ that an expatriate community of foreigners, from various European countries and Great Powers, has formed there. Doubtlessly, this is a direct effect of our government's policy of open ports and borders. This influx might be positive, as our government seems to believe, however some voices have less kind things to say about the foreigners.
EVTDESC13015;A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who left $COUNTRY$ some time ago on an expedition to $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been viciously refused entry to the country. It appears that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has turned gradually to a policy of increasing isolationism, most likely in order to avoid the pains of modernizing their political, economical and social institutions. This policy of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is, obviously, impairing the advances of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ trade, diplomacy and missionary activities in the region, and must be considered an unjust restriction of the international freedom of movement.
EVTDESC13020;An old pond\nA frog jumps in e\nThe sound of water.'\n\n-- Matsuo Basho\n\n$PROVINCENAME$ is bustling with rumors about the strange people who were found along its shorelines earlier this morning. The more precise origin of these shipwrecked sailors is as of yet uncertain, but, wherever they are from, they are definitely not $COUNTRY_ADJ$.
EVTDESC13030;One of our subjects in $PROVINCENAME$ was discovered wearing foreign clothes, and further interrogation by the authorities has lead to the slow unraveling of a foreign smuggling ring.
EVTDESC13040;Despite the obvious rightness of our isolationist policies, some amounts of foreign trade goods could be useful, and elements within our administration have suggested setting up a limited trading post in $PROVINCENAME$, where foreign ships can moor and trade, without compromising the overall intactness of our policy of separateness from the world outside $COUNTRYNAME$. It could be an economic boon to the area and the nation, but conservative voices warn that destructive foreign influences might creep into our society.
EVTDESC13050;A sweet, pungent stench hangs over the backstreets and alleys in $PROVINCENAME$, emanating and spreading in every direction from an epicenter at the foreign trade station. The European traders have brought with them the habit of opium smoking, and our subjects have taken to it on a scale that threatens to become epidemic. It seems that, for every new ship that lands, more and more of our people get caught in the deadly and pacifying web of addiction. What should we do?
EVTDESC13055;The great clippers ply our coastlines from north to south, like wolves culling out the weak and the corruptible with the poison they sell. Wherever there is an unexposed harbor, a foreign ship soon docks, and drives another fang into our national body. The use of opium has spread to $PROVINCENAME$.
EVTDESC13060;The use of opium in a neighboring province has now spread to the inland. Farmers and laborers in $PROVINCENAME$ fail to turn up for work, and entire fields fall fallow, as the people of $PROVINCENAME$ slip further and further down into the mists of consuming dependence.
EVTDESC13065;We find that your country is sixty or seventy thousand li from $COUNTRY$. Yet there are barbarian ships that strive to come here for trade for the purpose of making a great profit. The wealth of $COUNTRY$ is used to profit the barbarians. By what right do they then in return use the poisonous drug to injure the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people?'\n\nOne of our governors has taken the opium problem into his own hands, and written a letter to a foreign head of state, questioning the morality of their support of the opium trade.
EVTDESC13070;Rangaku', literally translated as 'Dutch learning', and by extension 'Western learning', is a Japanese word used to describe a particular body of knowledge and learning imported from the west via a Dutch trading station at Dejima. Something similar has occurred at the trading station in $PROVINCENAME$, where local officials are busy translating western books and treatises on science, advancing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ science and understanding of the world.
EVTDESC13080;He hides his face and speaks with controlled anger. A local aristocrat in $PROVINCENAME$ has been insulted by one of the foreigners living there. Apparently, the foreigner in question failed to bow in the appropriate manner when passing the aristocrat on the street. Shall we tolerate such blatant ignorance of our customs?
EVTDESC13090;He unveils the device with the excitement of a child. - 'You can see their eyes!', he cries, pointing excitedly at the jar of beetles. He instructs you to look into the object -- the glass and metal is cold against your face -- there, in curves of an optic lens, reality is magnified ten times over. - 'It's a microscope!, he laughs. - 'I bought it from one of the foreigners in $PROVINCENAME$!'
EVTDESC13100;The foreigners have gone too far! Their missionaries spread false teachings, subverting our people and our national unity, they break our customs, and their opium clouds our minds. At least that is the message you will get if you ask the people in $PROVINCENAME$ where anti-foreign sentiments have been running high for the past months.
EVTDESC13110;We have decided to open our doors to the West, and if we expect our subjects to embrace this policy, it becomes important that we ourselves, the Royal family, set good examples. Well educated leaders will be absolutely essential if we are to fully take our rightful place in the court of nations, and by sending our progeny abroad for education in Europe, or by hiring Westerners to educate them here, we can accomplish just that. What say you, your majesty?
EVTDESC13120;The European governess we have hired to educate the court seems to be doing fairly well at her job, but she has been introducing some rather strange ideas around the place. For instance, she has been throwing around, in quite harsh language, the idea that all men are created equal, and that $COUNTRY$ should abolish the time-honored institution of slavery. I don't know, your majesty, this sounds like dangerous stuff...
EVTDESC13130;One of the Great Powers of the West has taken an interest in our country, and has offered to establish a military mission. While this might be beneficial to our research, it might also prove a liability in the event of war, however, turning down such a generous offer might be perceived as somewhat of an insult. Do we wish to allow the establishment of a military mission?
EVTDESC13140;Some intelligence concerning our military preparations has spread from the military mission in $PROVINCENAME$, severely hurting our war effort. We have expelled the members of the mission, but the damage has already been done.
EVTDESC13160;Sailors winding up drunk in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ prisons aren't normally affairs of state, but this is an exception. A navyman from one of the Great Powers has been arrested by officials in $PROVINCENAME$, after having murdered one of our subjects in what appears to have started as a bar fight. The diplomatic attache insists that the sailor be handed over to the country in question, and tried according to their laws. This presents us with a conundrum. Granting this privilege once is tantamount to allowing extraterritoriality to all foreign subjects, but not doing so might very well cause international uproar. This issue merits careful consideration.
EVTDESC13170;A depesch has arrived from our attache in $FROMCOUNTRY$, detailing the tragedy of a sailor in our merchant marine. Apparently, the sailor killed a local in a scuffle during an extended shore leave in $FROMPROVINCE$. Despite pressures from our diplomatic mission, he was later tried and executed according to $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ laws. While we mourn his passing, we should also take some time to consider what we should do about this grave and serious insult to our national honor.
EVTDESC13180;News reaches us from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that they have decided to allow foreigners to be tried according to the laws of their native countries. Doubtlessly caused by pressure from within the circles of the Great Powers, these are good news nevertheless.
EVTDESC13190;With the European presence in our part of the world steadily increasing, the need for military reform becomes more dire every day. Where the Europeans field regiments of drilled professionals, we meet them with an army that is old and outdated, and organised along the lines of clan, family, nobility and personal loyalties.
EVTDESC13200;We have suffered a defeat. Despite our policy of splendid isolation, a hostile world has made inroads into ours. $SPHEREMASTER$ has forced our country open, and the gravitation of their might and power has brought our political life into orbit around theirs. Foreign traders, missionaries and spies pour across our borders, all the while undermining our traditional sovereignty over this, our homeland. No longer the masters of our own fate, our first priority now is to obey. But some dark night...
EVTDESC13201;News reaches us from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that the local ruling elites have thrown our ambassador out of the country, and that their troops are laying siege to our embassy with apparent intent to enforce that decision. This affair is developing into an enormous loss of international face, one which can only be avoided through a formal declaration of war against $FROMCOUNTRY$. Sire, how should we respond?
EVTDESC13210;So shall ye not only be Our good and faithful subjects, but render illustrious the best traditions of your forefathers.'\n\n$COUNTRYNAME$'s educational system is deeply mired in ancient tradition and long-established dogma. While it has helped maintain the traditional order in eras past, the old system has a hard time integrating the new knowledge that is spreading from the civilized nations of the west. By reforming the system we risk upsetting the vested interests of the traditionalists, but can we afford not to?
EVTDESC13220;Several of the Great Powers have in the past few years sought to establish formalized and permanent embassies in $COUNTRYNAME$, but up until now we've turned down their proposals. However, an idea has been floating around the capital that we should perhaps allow them to set up these embassies after all, provided they are all kept in one place where we can exact some amount of control over them. Perhaps a Legation Quarter in $PROVINCENAME$ could be just the thing?
EVTDESC13230;Wandering alone in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ can be a dangerous thing, as a foreign ambassador in the Legation Quarter recently found out. Guards report having found him dead at 4 a.m. in the morning, apparently the victim of a robbery, however the foreigners accuse us of having failed in our supposed responsibility to protect their diplomats. We fear that even a formal apology will not be enough to placate them, however, something more tangible might...
EVTDESC13240;The oil lamp flickered, casting an orange, sooty glow across the moist brown of the cargo hold. The average ship docking in $PROVINCENAME$ carried very little to raise an eyebrow, but years of being fooled and fooled again by foreign merchants, trying to dodge some excise or other, had left him with a sixth sense for when things were out of order. A rat scurrying between some crates tipped him off. A sweet, pungent scent too familiar not to be alluring. Opium. A cargo hold full of opium.
EVTDESC13250;One of our traders was turned away from the port in $FROMPROVINCE$ some time ago. Apparently he was discovered by local customs officials trying to smuggle opium, despite the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ban on opium imports. A liberal politician in our lower house has addressed the matter.\n\n'The right to trade freely, and openly, across the seas and on land, is one of the unalienable rights of mankind. Our rights have been denied in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and I for one wonder how long the government will stand for these slights at the hands of uncivilized heathens.
EVTDESC13260;Your trading restrictions are a disgrace to the world, and to yourself. Loyal $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ subjects, merely wishing to see their rights of trade upheld, have been turned away from your ports, and we request that this slight be immediately undone. $COUNTRYNAME$ will cease this infraction, or prepare itself to face the consequences.
EVTDESC13270;The trade disputes between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and the Great Powers had been on-going since the latter half of the 18th century. Tensions finally escalated to the boiling point in $MONTH$ of $YEAR$, when $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials had repeatedly turned down $COUNTRY_ADJ$ requests for unlimited trade access, including a lifting of the ban on the sale of opium. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, already deeply invested in a policy of confrontation, found itself with no options but to declare war, thus, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Opium War begun.
EVTDESC13280;The reforms sweeping through our country have upset the landed elites in $PROVINCENAME$.
EVTDESC13290;Our defeat in the last war has left us with the clear realization that certain things within our country need to adapt to the realities of the new world, and a quick campaign of reform could bring us up to speed.
EVTDESC13300;The blue of the day is undisturbed by the stillness of the ocean, and the sun drinking in deep gulps the waters off the $PROVINCENAME$ coast. Somewhere in the clear beyond a sea gull cries, knowing nothing of the courses and events that guide the lives of men and nations. The calm of our nation is that of undisturbed centuries when, suddenly, there is a rift in the blue. Far off where the ocean meets the sky, there is a field of white, soon cleaving the horizon in two: the rift of a sail, and a flag. The ship off our coastline is not $COUNTRY_ADJ$, it is European. At the moment, we do not know its intentions. What should we do about this ship in the blue?
EVTDESC13305;The foreigners tell many stories. Many of them tell the story of a man who rode into a city on the back of a donkey. Perhaps this was the man who rode into $PROVINCENAME$ today? We do not know yet why this strange foreigner has come to $PROVINCENAME$, but he has been contacting local officials, and seems intent on staying.
EVTDESC13310;The foreigners in $PROVINCENAME$ have revealed the purpose of their being here! They have decided to set up a missionary station!
EVTDESC13320;The Westerners in $PROVINCENAME$ have opened a school for education in Western science and art.
EVTDESC13330;Traders from the Great Powers have been active in $PROVINCENAME$ for some time, and the province has now developed into quite a little hub for trade with the rest of the world.
EVTDESC13340;The Europeans have established a coaling station in $PROVINCENAME$ to refuel their ships.
EVTDESC13352;Up and down the barracks grounds they march, in files and rows and ranks, the motions and orders of the commanding officer transplanting through the mass of men like a wave. A few months ago, these recruits were mere peasants, simple farmers, who had never held guns in their lives. Now they are fast becoming soldiers, thinking with the mind of one, but executing with the force of a hundred. We are beginning to understand the source of European military strength.
EVTDESC13355;The Old Summer Palace, known in Chinese as the Gardens of Perfect Brightness, is a complex of gardens northwest of the Imperial City in Beijing, China. This massive garden and palace complex was built during the 18th and early 19th centuries, and have for a long time functioned as a place of residence and office for the Qing Emperors. Known for its splendor, this palace stands as a tribute to the achievements of the Chinese culture. Today, we received news that $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers occupying Beijing have burnt the palace to the ground. A whole nation mourns as news of this barbarous act of culturcide spread throughout China, and the world.
EVTDESC13356;The Righteous Society of Harmonious fists, known colloquially as 'Boxers' -- a Chinese movement dedicated to restoring what they perceive to be a loss of Chinese independence in face of European expansion in Asia -- have carried out massacres on European missionaries and traders in China. Along with Europeans unfortunate enough to come in their path, several Chinese Christian converts have also been brutally slaughtered. The Chinese government appears unconcerned with these atrocities, and some rumors claim that the Imperial Qing government is even lending its tacit support to the movement.
EVTDESC13360;The Westerners in $PROVINCENAME$ have established a diplomatic mission for the furthering of diplomatic contacts and for cultural exchange between us and the West.
EVTDESC13400;- 'It is beautiful!', she exclaims, her voice bubbling over with childish giggle. The European traders in $PROVINCENAME$ bring ashore the most curious things from their countries, but nothing more curious than the exquisite sofa -- they say it was made fr
EVTDESC13410;The starry skies above $COUNTRY$ have held the guiding lights of our nation since the dawn of time, but never before has our destiny been so clearly plain to see. The traders in $PROVINCENAME$ have brought in a state of the art telescope to $COUNTRY$, and, with it, the mysteries of the heavens now lie clear and open for us to explore. The trade in $PROVINCENAME$ is proving quite beneficial to our research.
EVTDESC13420;She has been lying in bed for days, vaguely complaining, far off in a feverish mist, of a headache. Her forehead feels warm like an oven, and she cringes restlessly back and forth, her motions dull from exhaustion. Even with all the proper cleansing rituals and potions tried, our doctors have been unable to help her. We have almost given up hope, when, suddenly, her young son bursts into the room, accompanied by a European from the local trading station! - 'This will fix her right up!', the trader says, producing a small glass flask from his coat pocket. - 'Warburg's Tincture! Nothing puts malaria on the run quite like a few drops of Warburg's!' Within days, she is back on her legs.
EVTDESC140;Members of the temperance movement have picketed a saloon in $PROVINCENAME$ today, claiming that the alcohol provided by the institution is responsible for countless broken homes, marriages, windows, noses and lives all across $STATENAME$. The picketers demanded, in no uncertain terms, that the institution be closed, and only a police presence at the scene prevented the picketers from taking that matter into their own hands.
EVTDESC14000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism? We report, you decide.
EVTDESC14010;The election debates in $COUNTRY$ have been going on for a few days now, and the issue that seems to be becoming the determining one for the outcome of the election is, perhaps unsurprisingly, the economy. Several theories are being advanced, but the voters want a clear statement on government policy. How will the government make sure that every $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen has a chicken in his pot, during the coming term in office?
EVTDESC14020;The morality and virtue of our people has started to decline!' The statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality, on the campaign trail in $COUNTRY$. Many have begun questioning the country's view on religion, and there is no doubt that these issues will play their part in the coming election.
EVTDESC14030;Two debaters are arguing heatedly in the qualmy air of the town hall The audience sits dumbfounded as words like 'aliens', 'minorities', and 'ethnic and cultural groups' are thrown between the two. One argues that immigrants are to adopt the dominant culture of their new homeland, while his opponent believes that immigrants should retain their cultural heritage, and that $COUNTRY$ will be strengthened by the influx of a fresh perspective..
EVTDESC14040;Opponents and proponents of the military and the armed forces are taking sides for the coming election. While militarists argue that increased tension in the world, and arms races between several of the Great Powers, are reason enough to maintain a strong $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military. Others are less convinced, and see the military expenses as excesses on part of the government.
EVTDESC14050;Smuggling has become a problem since $COUNTRY$ raised a local Sales & Transfer tariff on several important trade goods, and the issue has become a point of contention in the coming election. Several arguments are being put forth on the issue.
EVTDESC14060;New foreign, products have begun to out compete several items of $COUNTRY$ produce, and some citizens report increasing difficulties in competing with imported goods on the market. The issue has been raised by local politicians in debates for the upcoming election.
EVTDESC14070;Merchants from $COUNTRY$ are arguing with the minister of finance, who has entertained plans of a nationalization of certain private industries. The heated discussion have reach your ears and you try to cool both sides down.
EVTDESC14080;The production quota is too high. We will never be able to reach the demand.' The other farmers stand behind him, waiting. Their weathered faces show the same concern and determination as their speaker.
EVTDESC14090;A debate has flared up in the local $COUNTRY$ election about whether the state should interfere or not in the local economy. Proponents of State capitalism are arguing that a more direct system of government investment and reinvestment could aid in the long term development of local industry.
EVTDESC14100;Local $COUNTRY$ administration has come under criticism for several instances of government subsidies directed at supporting local industry.  Opponents argue that 'the country's economic planners cannot detect consumer preferences, shortages, and surpluses with sufficient accuracy and therefore cannot efficiently co-ordinate production', and creeping statism has begun to worry the residents of $COUNTRY$.
EVTDESC14110;Some of the Faithful in $COUNTRY$ feel that the state has failed in giving them due recognition for their hard work since the last election. For years, they argue, they have assisted the local community in many ways: caring for the sick, taking care of the orphans and helping the needy. They feel that they deserve some form of support so they can continue to help people, and the issue has become a topic of much discussion in the local election campaign.
EVTDESC14120;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ religious policy has become a subject of much debate in the local $COUNTRY$ elections. Many argue that the state needs to maintain a watchful policy of secularization, but this threatens to upset long established religious privileges, and is opposed by many of the local faithful.
EVTDESC14130;Religion has become an issue in the upcoming electoral debates, as a local religious leader in $COUNTRY$ protests the freedom of religious conversions, arguing that the size of his flock is diminishing, and that this change is fundamentally harmful to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ moral fabric.
EVTDESC14140;The renovation of a local church, using public money, has become a hot topic in the local election of $COUNTRY$. Supporters of the project argue that some government support for religion will help preserve not only faith among the people, and thus a local vanguard against the forces of revolution, while opponents argue that the state must not intervene in matters of private religiosity.
EVTDESC14150;The current inflow of immigrants has created a demand for more jobs. Advocates of immigrant rights demand that newly naturalized citizens be accorded the same rights as residents by birth. The situation has become a topic of debate in the local election.
EVTDESC14160;Certain residents of $COUNTRY$ feel that the state discriminates against them on account of their origin, and this has become a bone of some contention in the local election, as liberals argue that immigrants and aliens should have their rights respected. Opponents and, indeed, public opinion, seems to be of the mind that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ is not something that one can simply become overnight, and that the process of naturalization takes years, if not generations.
EVTDESC14170;Immigration has become a major issue in the local $COUNTRY$ elections, as liberals argue the need to extend the voting franchise to all members of our society, including immigrants. Others, perhaps afraid to see old privileges dislodged, are not as convinced. As the election draws nearer, the debate rages in $COUNTRY$.
EVTDESC14180;The debate in $COUNTRY$ in the preludes to the coming election mostly concerns the military and defense policies of $COUNTRY$. The state has long been a bastion of hawkish sentiments with regards to foreign policy, and this year does not seem to be an exception. It is clear that jingoistic policies will be favored in voter turnouts, but a turn in the debate could perhaps reduce the impact.
EVTDESC14190;Your generals have begun to complain about the bad food the soldiers are getting and command that more money should be spent on feeding them. The generals argue that the poor diet reduces soldiers' fighting spirit and want to raise it through better food. These issues have become topics of importance to the many military families in $COUNTRY$.
EVTDESC14200;A major report that most of the soldiers' weapons are nearly worn out and want someone to go over them to see if they need to be scrapped. To provide soldiers with new weapons would cost more than the current budget for the military can cope with.
EVTDESC14210;Pacifist sentiments have been floating about $COUNTRY$ for some time, but in this coming election it seems that whoever can capitalize on the pacifist sentiments in the area will come out a clear winner come election day. The only question still in the air is to which extent pacifist sympathies will hold up through the pre-election debates.
EVTDESC14500;A dry spell in one of our colonies has caused friction between colonial officials and locals. The lion's share of the reservoired water in the area has been diverted to colonial factories and plantations, leaving many local smallholders with insufficient water for irrigation. As the days turn into weeks, tensions continue to rise. Diverting more water to local farms is an option, but might be viewed internationally as a sign of weakness.
EVTDESC14510;And it seems to me a travesty that traders long established be allowed these special and, indeed, unfair, prerogatives with regards to the reaping of our common colonial harvest. Paid for, I might add, from the national treasury. Are these benefits to be reaped solely by profiteers and first-comers?'\n\nA debate in parliament concerning the status of traders and trading in our colonies has exploded into a regular fist-fight, as an MP sympathetic to one of our colonial companies lunged at a vocal supporter of free trade, when the latter presented the above accusations to the chamber. This might be a good time to reconsider our colonial trading charters
EVTDESC14520;A colonial charter company has approached us with a request to incorporate a new colonial factory in one of our colonies. While the factory would help local production efficiency, it is also clear that the plans call for the appropriation of several thousand acres worth of land belonging to natives. We will have to weigh the pros of production against the cons of dispossessed, angry natives.
EVTDESC14530;... and I argue that this present resurgence of native unrest in the colony is due only to the continued, repeated and wanton mismanagement that our own officials have imposed on the locals. For if the purpose of our presence in our far flung colonies is to uplift and educate, our failure is all the worse when we accomplish the exact opposite.'\n\nNative militancy is rising in one of our colonies, and reports are reaching $CAPITAL$ that the reason for this surge in violence is several incidents of colonial mismanagement. We can seek to redress the problem by finding scapegoats in the Colonial Office, but happy bureaucrats might be more important than happy natives in some god-forsaken colony.
EVTDESC14540;From the Congo Basin to the deepest fathoms of the Bengal, from the jungles of India to the coasts of Java, scientific taxonomy is making new advances daily. As the light of civilization spreads to even the darkest corners of the earth, the Creator's secrets are, little by little, being unraveled. Turn over any old rock in the colonies, and you will find yet another spectacular piece of miraculous fauna looking back at you, with at least one of its fifteen eyes.'\n\nNew species of exotic fauna are being discovered in the colonies, and a suggestion has been proposed to establish a Colonial Museum of Natural History.
EVTDESC14550;The riches of the colonies flow to our nation's coffers, but it is not only in monetary terms that our nation benefits from its possessions in the New Worlds. The single biggest gain from our colonial presence lies in the continually expanding venues and fields in which our technological advances can be applied, tried and tested.'\n\nCertain well-off philanthropists in $COUNTRY$ have decided to fund a colonial exposition to celebrate our colonies, our missionaries, and our Empire. The question is how we should advertise the exposition. A celebration of our technological prowess, or a grand salute to Empire?
EVTDESC14560;Here, in these far flung places, forgotten, it seems, by both God and Civilization, barbaric native practices, foreign to the mind of any civilized man, still persist, along with widespread illiteracy, unsanitary living conditions and the sheer ignorance of unenlightened minds.'\n\nThe Colonial Office has published a report on the social conditions in the colonies, and it is not exactly sunny reading. Many of the people in the colonies still live under the conditions of a European Dark Age, or worse, and the Colonial Office strongly suggests that something be done about it.
EVTDESC14570;Grievous discontent still persists in the colony, despite several attempts by local governors at mediation between local powerholders and the Central Government. The recommendation of the Colonial Office must be that we either take steps to make accommodations with the natives, or that we seek to undermine their authority by enforcing a greater measure of direct rule by the colonial Governor.'\n\nNatives in one of our colonies are dissatisfied with our rule, and we need to make a decision on how to deal with the discontent.
EVTDESC14580;Things have gone from bad to worse in $PROVINCENAME$, where the Colonial Police, while in pursuit of two locals suspected of murdering a colonial official, have happened to disturb a shrine of some importance to local religiosity. Natives in the area are infuriated over the perceived lack of respect for their religion.
EVTDESC14590;A colonial regiment in one of our states threatens to spring into open rebellion, following dissatisfaction over being led by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ commanders. According to military reports, the native recruits have had a hard time adapting to the strict military discipline of a modern army, but a minority report from the Colonial Office speaks of several instances of pugilism and poor behavior from our officers.
EVTDESC14600;It is unclear if there was, perhaps, something in the air that year. Some theorized that it might have been due to unusual solar activity, others maintained it was nothing but a series of unfortunate coincidences -- a convergence of catastrophes, if you will -- but, whatever had caused it, $YEAR$ saw a wave of unrest spreading through the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies like wildfire through a dry brushland.'\n\nA wave of unrest shakes our colonies, and we must decide on how to handle it. Concessions to the natives will come at the price of a serious loss of international face, but can we handle not giving them?
EVTDESC14610;Tensions in $PROVINCENAME$, $STATENAME$, have been running high for quite some time, but lately there seems to have been a change in the wind. Things seem calmer in the area, for some reason, and many militants are returning to useful occupations. It might be that we are perceived as too strong to resist, but it might also just be that the anger has burned itself out.
EVTDESC14620;The high militancy in $PROVINCENAME$, $STATENAME$, has erupted into a statewide emergency, as violent fighting and looting breaks out on the streets. The situation threatens to turn into a massacre unless something is done soon. Colonial Police are standing by, ready to intervene and attempt to restore order, but are holding back pending detailed instructions from the Governor.
EVTDESC14630;And it is therefore the strongest possible recommendation of the Colonial Office that the colony in question be reorganized and reincorporated to prevent the further slide into bureaucratic mismanagement that it has experienced over the past few years, lest wanton spending of public resources, corruption and inefficiencies should all become its bywords.'\n\nOne of our colonies has, due to the lack of an efficient administration, descended into a state of widespread mismanagement. The Colonial Office suggests a reincorporation of the colony to get rid of the problems, but that might be unpopular with the locals.
EVTDESC14640;While anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ sentiments have been festering in the colony for some time, it is only very recently that the simmering discontent has erupted into open violence. During the past few months alone, three colonial officials have been killed in the colony, and it is becoming increasingly clear that something must be done about the situation, lest it spin out of control.'\n\nThe calm in one of our colonies has proved deceptive, as native unrest and displeasure with colonial rule has flashed into a state of near open rebellion in a matter of days. The calm before the storm is decidedly over.
EVTDESC14650;Lions, Elephants, Giraffes, Buffalo, Panthers and Rhinoceros, the magic and attraction of Africa certainly lies to no small an extent in its many and varied flora and fauna. Big Game hunting has become a major attraction in $PROVINCENAME$, bringing in tourists and tax revenue to all of $STATENAME$. A proposal has surfaced that we invite foreign dignitaries to partake in the $PROVINCENAME$ hunting. While this will certainly boost our international prestige, the locals might not be too happy about tourists trampling around in their plantations.
EVTDESC14660;Heia Safari! There is much to see in the $PROVINCENAME$ wilds, and what better way is there to see it than on a safari? Put on your pith helmet and saddle up, because tonight we ride 'til the sun sets, or rises, depending on the heat. $PROVINCENAME$ has become quite a little magnet for wealthy Europeans wanting to experience the beauty and magic of Africa first hand, and modern steamers bring them in like never before. The local fauna has, indeed, been gifted with a new species of wildlife lately: The European Safari-goer.
EVTDESC14670;And it was only when I saw how they treated them... that I. There was this one child, I remember him well. Eight... nine, maybe. They all had quotas for how much to pick each day, and that one day. He didn't fulfill his. Don't ask me why. I... his hands...!'\n\n$COUNTRY$ is in shock, as a major European newspaper published a report today on the conditions in one of her colonies. Brutal mistreatment of natives, corporeal punishment and repeated instances of bodily mutilation have all been established means of maintaining the colonial order in the colony, in mines and on plantations, which have all been kept outside the influence of the Colonial Office through an elaborate system of bribes and corruption.
EVTDESC14680;Land! Liberty! Labour!'\n\nThe Colonial Office has suggested we organize a recruitment drive to get more of our people to migrate to the colonies, so as to establish a more permanent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ presence in them. The Office has found a colony which it deems suitable for such a drive, and the proposal is really only awaiting our signature.
EVTDESC14690;I was born under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. All my life, I have dressed in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clothes, been taught and spoken the language of $COUNTRY$. It should not surprise anyone that I am willing to die for my country.'\n\nA tradition of support for $COUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has taken hold in one of our colonies, and several natives have expressed support for ideas, that have floated about the Colonial Office for some time, of setting up native military regiments to help maintain order in our Colonies.
EVTDESC14700;Me say, load the Banana Boat all night long. Day de light and I wanna go home.'\n- The Banana Boat Song\n\nWith the expansion of our colonial ventures, goods previously unknown to the general public are increasingly being shipped overseas to be enjoyed back home. A banana boat has just docked in one of our harbors, and our citizens marvel at the sweetness and strange looks of this amazing new fruit, previously unknown to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public, as it is being unloaded by the crateload. People are, quite literally, going bananas.
EVTDESC14710;So, you see, if $CAPITAL$ could, perhaps, be able to lend us a hand in this little venture of ours, we would be very, very pleased.'\n\nThe government has been approached by several leading members of the country's industrialist elite, who believe that they have found a new possibly profitable racket to dip their fingers in. The proposal concerns one of our colonies, where several acres of viable farmland could potentially be exploited more efficiently under new and industrialized forms of agriculture. Naturally, this proposal would require the expropriation by the state of said land, to then be sold at a fair market price to the interests of capital. Mere technicalities, am I right?
EVTDESC14720;And what I can not fathom is why our government insists on paying thousands, if not millions, of pounds, yearly, to maintain imperialistic projects overseas that serve only as strains on the national budget. We were not invited to the colonies, and, frankly, I find our presence in them to be rude.'\n\nAn anti-colonial malaise has taken hold in $COUNTRY$, where more and more of our people are beginning to question our colonial ambitions. The colonies are increasingly being seen more as burdens than as boons, and this situation is beginning to hamper our ability to motivate them before the general public.
EVTDESC14730;And when we consider the injustices, wrought by representatives of $COUNTRY$ in the colonies, we will not be surprised to find that '$COUNTRY_ADJ$', in those many places, far beyond our country's shores, has become a byword for theft, larceny and murder. Our message here today is loud and clear: $COUNTRY$! Quit the colonies!'\n\nAn Anti-Colonial League has been formed by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ radicals. Ostensibly dominated by intellectuals arguing the cause of colonial independence, reports from our Secret Police make it evident that the League is intimately connected with the Socialist Internationale.
EVTDESC14740;With the competition for colonies constantly increasing, as European nations scramble for Africa and the World, $COUNTRY$ has done well for itself. One $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony has, in the past few years, become internationally recognized as the model of a well managed European colony, and the attention that this colony has garnered for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial policy, in the parliaments and courts of Europe, is proving a wonderful boon for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ research and international prestige.
EVTDESC14750;And while I fully respect my colleague from the loyal opposition, I still cannot help but to question his motives in again and again bringing up the subject of the expenses of the Colonial Office. The colonies are a cornerstone of government policy, and worth paying for.'\n\nThe colonies are making headlines in $COUNTRY$ again, following a fierce debate in the Upper House. Members of the opposition have argued in favor of a reduction of the budget alotted to the Colonial Office, and both they and majority MPs have conducted major offensives in the Upper House, to try and convince swing-voters and aisle-crossers to come out in support of their respective policies.
EVTDESC14760;A slowly unraveling corruption scandal in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Colonial Office shakes $CAPITAL$, as a major newspaper publishes reports detailing an extensive network of bribes and favors, designed to give certain private interests preferential treatment with regards to colonial trade and exploitation. Critics of government policy point to the relatively low wages and poor funds alotted to colonial officials as determining reasons for the scandal, while the prevailing mood in government circles seems to be that a culture of corruption within the private sector is to blame for the poor state of the Colonial Office.
EVTDESC14770;The growth of our colonies has turned $CAPITAL$ into the constantly expanding cultural and economic nave of an Empire. Every day, with every passing hour, people from every conceivable corner, of the world we have made ours, arrive in our capital: To court our ministers, to trade with merchants, engineers and industrialists, and to experience any one of the multitude of fates that $CAPITAL$ affords its visitors. Standing at $CAPITAL$ Central, one can see all around oneself a small panorama of the world, hear spoken any and all of the varying tongues and languages of the world and smell both the scents and the odors of far away lands. In the annals of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Empire, the years around $YEAR$ will always be remembered as the golden age of $CAPITAL$.
EVTDESC14780;While the discovery of new lands has always meant the discovery of new diseases and malaises, one of our colonies has recently begun to develop a reputation of being a particularly disease-ridden place. From malaria to colds both common and uncommon, it seems that travelers to and from the colony always catch or bring that little something unsavory extra. According to reports published by a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ doctor established in the colony, a concerted government effort at draining local swamps and marshes, as well as at improving local sanitation, could help the colony, but, of course, such efforts are not free.
EVTDESC14790;One of our colonies is reporting astounding successes in the development of local commercial ventures and businesses to the Colonial Office. According to the local governor, the primary reason seems to be an ambitious land reform, undertaken in tandem with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ capitalists and industrialists. The colony is reportedly becoming more attractive to immigrants, and the report reflects well on our industrialists as well.
EVTDESC14800;An archeological excavation in one of our colonies has yielded fantastic results in the form of several artifacts, tentatively dated to the late paleolithic. The discovery promises to give us new insights in the ancient life and development of the area, and The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ National Archeological society is hailing the discoveries as a great breakthrough for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archeology. The artifacts obviously need to be put in a museum, but where should we put them? The Archeological society strongly argues in favor of The $CAPITAL$ Museum of History, while others have hinted that it might be better to just put them in a local museum.
EVTDESC14810;A situation has presented itself in one of our colonies, where several prominent $CAPITAL$ capitalists have controlling interests in local trade. One of their ventures, a small, local machine shop, run by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ specialists, works on western industrial standards well into the small hours of the morning. The sound from the machine shop is preventing anyone and everyone in the immediate vicinity of the shop from getting much sleep at night, and the issue has become a symbol for many, broader, pent up frustrations with our colonial rule.
EVTDESC150;For it is not in the nature of a man of real, unadulterated faith to spend his life idly wasting away under the shackles of an oppressing and unquestioned vice. We must strive for the betterment of ourselves, and of our communities, by expelling from them, once and for all, the pernicious influence of the spirit in the bottle, and raise our eyes, instead, to the spirit in the sky.'\n\nThe Temperance movement has been gaining traction in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ religious circles, and a tent meeting held in one of our states is a prime expression of that sentiment.
EVTDESC15000;Dissent has been growing among the $PROVINCECULTURE$ population in $PROVINCENAME$ for some time, and tensions now threaten to reach the boiling point after local police tried to disperse a crowd in violation of the ban on public meetings. The situation escalated with violence on both sides, and a young boy was killed when police resorted to firearms.
EVTDESC15010;As a part of our governments citizenship policy, soldiers of the home army have been ordered only to buy goods from $COUNTRYCULTURE$ traders. This is starting to aggravate already existing tensions in $PROVINCENAME$, as local $PROVINCECULTURE$ traders feel the effects of government discrimination.
EVTDESC15020;Avast! Awake ye, sons of slumber! The morning calls you forth!'\n\nA $PROVINCECULTURE$ poet, disturbed by the lack of a $PROVINCECULTURE$ national consciousness, has published a hymn to his native country that is quickly developing into a symbol of the national resistance against our rule in $PROVINCENAME$. We could get rid of the poet, but doing so does entail the risk of being discovered. How should we act?
EVTDESC15030;The schools in $PROVINCENAME$ are heavily geared toward supporting the small $COUNTRYCULTURE$ minority there, and, as a result, our $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens feel oppressed. While allowing some temporary leniency in these policies could be beneficial to our technological progress, it could also be a seed of $PROVINCECULTURE$ revolution, and an end to our rule here.
EVTDESC15040;And let the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ know that we do not sit idly by while they cull the sheep of our flock.'\n\nA local preacher in $PROVINCENAME$ has been preaching national resistance against our rule, and he is but a symptom of a broader disease. In fact, much of the $PROVINCENAME$ clergy has been acting uppity lately.
EVTDESC15050;A paper dedicated to the cause of independence has begun circulating among the $PROVINCECULTURE$ minority in $PROVINCENAME$. Using some obscure press laws we could attempt to shut it down, but our hand in that would be obvious, so it might be preferable to just let it run its course.
EVTDESC15060;It's a public secret that The First Farmer's Bank of $PROVINCENAME$ is a part of the $PROVINCECULTURE$ resistance. Opposition to our rule, and to $COUNTRYCULTURE$ settlement in the province, is staunch within the institution, and the bank has even gone so far as to bidding out land to prevent it from being bought by non-$PROVINCECULTURE$. There has been talk in local government circles of pushing for a nationalization of the bank, but fear of a fierce reaction has caused them to raise the issue with the national government. How should we react to this?
EVTDESC15070;A trade union for $PROVINCECULTURE$ labourers and craftsmen has formed illegally in $PROVINCENAME$, and local authorities have brought the matter to our attention. Shutting down the operations of the Union is necessary to avoid a complete halt to industrial output in the province, but doing so might cause aggravations, how should we proceed?
EVTDESC15080;The writing on the wall has been plain to see for some time, but officials in $PROVINCENAME$ now have definite confirmation that the locals are plotting an insurgency against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. The Secret Police has managed to secure detailed plans for the insurgency through informants and double-agents, and needs to know how to act. Our options are to fight the insurgents in one concentrated battle, or to try to divide them up and dissipate their forces out into the surrounding countryside.
EVTDESC15090; A young $PROVINCECULTURE$ boy in $PROVINCENAME$ has had to learn the hard way that one does not insult officers of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army without it having its consequences. As he comes to his senses again, he puts his fingers to his nose and draws them back red with blood. The standing army in $PROVINCENAME$ is causing strain on our relations with the locals. We could enforce a stricter code of conduct, but that would cause uproar in the capital.
EVTDESC15100;So take arms! Impoverished, starved and hungry brethren of $PROVINCENAME$. In name of our Lord and in defense of eternal rights, let us drive the occupiers out of our native land!' Local aristocrats in $PROVINCENAME$ are arguing revolution against our rule. We could confront them now, but then again it might be better to wait for another opportunity.
EVTDESC15110;A historian of some renown has published a book on $PROVINCECULTURE$ history in $PROVINCENAME$. This book has the potential to become fairly explosive stuff among the $PROVINCECULTURE$ minority, but we are in a position to exert some influence over it's distribution. If we curtail the distribution, only the higher classes will have access to the book. If, on the other hand, do not curtail the distribution, then the book will probably instead see it's biggest readership among the middle classes. How should we proceed?
EVTDESC15120;The situation in the $PROVINCECULTURE$ provinces has reached the boiling point, and leading members of the $PROVINCECULTURE$ communities have assembled a national congress in $PROVINCENAME$. Citing the proud traditions of $PROVINCECULTURE$ autonomy and self-rule, the rights of peoples, and the repeated injuries suffered under what they refer to as the '$COUNTRY_ADJ$ yoke', they demand renewed independence.
EVTDESC15130;Routine maintenance of the road system in $PROVINCENAME$ threatens to spark conflict, as road sign language has become an issue. While our local authorities feel that using our own language would be best, some voices have been raised saying that we might offend local sensibilities by not using the local tongue. Using local placenames will hinder the province from integrating economically with the rest of our country, while using our own language will doubtlessly upset the locals. Regardless of which, the locals will feel that all roads in $COUNTRY$ lead to $CAPITAL$.
EVTDESC15140;A committee of $PROVINCECULTURE$ businessmen and traders from $PROVINCENAME$ have approached the government in $CAPITAL$, wishing to lodge a formal complaint with the open discrimination they face in competition for government contracts. Our government currently pursues a favorization policy -- preferring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ contractors wherever possible -- and this is causing discontent in the $PROVINCECULTURE$ provinces. The committee represents equally the interests of the artisan and capitalist classes of the province, and we could try to sow discontent among them.
EVTDESC15150;If $PROVINCENAME$ were the protagonist of a romantic play, then dark clouds, heralding storms, strife and conflict, would be hanging low on the horizon. The conflict between $PROVINCECULTURE$ locals and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ minority in $PROVINCENAME$ is heating up, and a distressing message has been sent to the government in $CAPITAL$, pleading for an intervention from the central government. Our options are to either conduct a crack-down on organized $PROVINCECULTURE$ groups in the province, or bide our time and hope that the situation resolves itself.
EVTDESC15160;A secret $COUNTRY_ADJ$ weapons cache in $PROVINCENAME$ was found broken up and looted early this morning. Among the loot was at least one major artillery piece. $PROVINCECULTURE$ partisans have claimed responsibility, and local officials are now fearful of having to deal with a heavily armed resistance in the event of a $PROVINCECULTURE$ uprising in $PROVINCENAME$. Concerns have also been raised that this will embolden the already radicalized $PROVINCECULTURE$ independence movement.
EVTDESC15170;Some of our industrial facilities in $PROVINCENAME$ have been damaged, and factory officials suspect that $PROVINCECULTURE$ saboteurs are behind the attack. We have no conclusive proof at the moment, but a thorough investigation might give us new insights, though it will cost us.
EVTDESC15180;The philosophy of Organic Work developed in occupied Poland, largely as a response to attempts at suppressing Polish national identity and culture undertaken by Prussian and Russian authorities. The philosophy, influenced by the Positivism of Auguste Comte, Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill, stated in essence that productive work, rather than revolution and uprising, was the key to developing a national consciousness and, ultimately, the way to peacefully strive for national liberation. As in Poland, so also in $PROVINCENAME$
EVTDESC15190;A planned uprising of the marginalized $PROVINCECULTURE$ nobility against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has quickly devolved into something else entirely. The peasants in $PROVINCENAME$, responding to appeals of loyalty to the cause of $COUNTRYNAME$, and resistance against the rebellious nobles, have risen up against the nobles! The peasant mobs have quickly gained the upper hand in the conflict, and we now have the option of intervening to suppress them, or letting them have their way with the aristocrats. Doing the former would leave us with fewer rebellious nobles, but it might be frowned upon by the rest of $CONTINENTNAME$.
EVTDESC15200;The signs have been evident for some time. Whispers can be heard on the barracks' grounds, and sometimes, when a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officer enters a room, even the liveliest of conversations seem to die down, as if it had bumped into some immutable hinder. The $PROVINCECULTURE$ Officers Corps in $PROVINCENAME$ is becoming increasingly attracted to the cause of $PROVINCECULTURE$ nationalism and separatism, and we can prove it. We have the options of ignoring these things for the time being, or getting rid of some of the more outspoken officers.
EVTDESC15210;The hands on the clock point five minutes to twelve. His eyes peer across the town square, seemingly undaunted by the commotion, and the risk. He climbs to the podium, and begins to speak. For hours, he talks. Of the $PROVINCECULTURE$ nation, its oppression, its cause, and its future, in a language that reverberates with nothing save the clear tones of a just cause. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ gendarmes storm the square, and soon he is gone. Somewhere, far away in the city, a bell strikes twelve. A young $PROVINCECULTURE$ nationalist is in our custody. What should we do with him?
EVTDESC15220;Their movements are sluggish. Often times, they can be seen milling about the barracks with little regard for military decorum. When called to attention, their hands draw toward their foreheads with just the right amount of delay. Not slow enough to deserve punishment, not fast enough to be a believable display of loyalty. These soldiers are $PROVINCECULTURE$, not $COUNTRY_ADJ$.
EVTDESC15230;An Arts & Letters club in a foreign country supports the cause of $PROVINCECULTURE$ independence, and is exchanging contacts with people in $PROVINCENAME$. We could take steps and measures to isolate $PROVINCENAME$ from harmful outside influences -- by, for example, having the Secret Police browse through incoming mail -- but this would of course cause a drop in relations with the foreign power in question. We could also simply ignore the issue, and allow our dissatisfied $PROVINCECULTURE$ subjects to establish international contacts, but that might not be the best idea.
EVTDESC15240;A small $PROVINCECULTURE$ patriotic society has reached local prominence in $PROVINCENAME$. Ostensibly claiming to simply organize $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens of $COUNTRY$ to benefit of the local community, we suspect that the organization is, in fact, covertly arguing, supporting, aiding and abetting the cause of $PROVINCECULTURE$ independence. We could shut it down, though that would cause a fair amount of militancy.
EVTDESC15250;Up until now, $PROVINCECULTURE$ priests in $PROVINCENAME$ have been allowed to conduct religious services in their own tongue. This generosity on our part has apparently been excessive, since the privilege has been used to spread anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda among the $PROVINCERELIGION$ congregations in $PROVINCENAME$. We could issue an edict to the effect that all religious services must be rendered in the official language of the state, but this will exasperate the clergy. Should we?
EVTDESC15260;In our efforts to assimilate our $PROVINCECULTURE$ provinces into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state, bright minds within our administration have come up with an idea to restrict the rights of the $PROVINCECULTURE$ minority, and others, to construct buildings and own land. While this measure will be extremely unpopular among our minorities, it will most likely hasten the assimilation process. Do we want to implement the building restrictions?
EVTDESC15270;Old man Dryzymala has come up with a cunning plan to circumvent the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ban on the erection of permanent houses for $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens, he lives in a wagon. Whenever our authorities try to book him for violating the ban, he calmly states that his dwelling has not been standing in the same place for 24 hours, and is therefore not a permanent building according to the letter of the law. Every morning at 0700 a.m., like clockwork, he moves the wagon a meter or two. We're becoming laughing stock!
EVTDESC15274;A foreign journalist has visited old man Dryzymala and his wagon, writing a story home about the old $PROVINCECULTURE$ man who is forced to live in a wagon to circumvent the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ anti-minority laws. The story has garnered a fair amount of attention back home, and the world is becoming increasingly aware of our efforts at suppressing the $PROVINCECULTURE$ minority.
EVTDESC15280;Assimilation efforts in $PROVINCECULTURE$ areas and territories are progressing slower than they should reasonably have to, and one of the reasons is that $PROVINCECULTURE$ children are still educated in their native tongue. By enforcing compliance to a national curricula, we can foster a new generation of children to identify more directly with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state.
EVTDESC15290;He holds his hand drawn back at a low angle, as if genuinely surprised at the strength of the blow it just delivered. The suspense is gone now, and he isn't angry any more, only terrified. Gritting her teeth, she says, in the stuttering tone of pain and a foreign tongue: 'There is a special place in hell for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ swine like you'. Those might be the only words of our language she'll ever learn. The next day, the incident known as The $PROVINCENAME$ School Strike of $YEAR$ is in full swing, as parents refuse to let their children set foot in the draconic system that is a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ school.
EVTDESC15300;Originally founded in 1862 as a Czech gymnastics movement in Prague, the Sokol movement soon spread further to other Slavic countries. While in theory a non-partisan organisation, the Sokol movement was in practice an important vehicle for the furthering of Czech nationalism and, later on, pan-slavic thought and ideology. The movement aimed to provide its members with comprehensive training of both mind and body, and its locales often acted as important forums for the dissemination of radical nationalist thought, for which it was several times suppressed by authorities.
EVTDESC15310;As she makes her way through the city, doding shadows as if they were $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers, the illuminated clock-tower of the church seems to glare at her like a mean, infected yellow eye. She's already late, but class is still in session.\n\nAn underground university has formed in $PROVINCENAME$, providing higher education despite the ban on minority languages in academia.
EVTDESC160;Influenced by intensive lobbying from the Temperance League, one of our states has adopted a licensing regulation that allows residents the right to issue or retract liquor licenses in their local districts. With strong public support, the Licensing Act has thus prohibited the sale of liquor throughout the state. Many local breweries have been denied the right to sell their produce locally, and have been forced into bankruptcy.
EVTDESC16000;A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently, half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved e I do not expect the house to fall e but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.' -- Abraham Lincoln\n\nIt is over. All attempts at compromise, the efforts of decades of public discourse on the issue of slavery, have failed. This morning the congressmen from the Southern states resigned their offices, and the slave states declared secession from the perpetual Union. The states of Missouri and Maryland, along with the Western Part of Virginia, have declared themselves for the Union, and Washington D.C. is under the control of Union troops. A southern wind blows hard on our house divided.
EVTDESC160001;A great rebellion has sundered all under Heaven!
EVTDESC16001;The one issue that the Founding Fathers of our great nation were never able to answer conclusively, was the question concerning the status of slavery within the union. This inflamed debate has only gained traction in the years since the revolution, and it is presently the singular most important issue on our country's political agenda. Some radical southerners feel that there is no possible compromise to be found on the issue, and that secession is the only alternative to being dominated into emancipation by the central power in Washington. Should our Senate ever be in a position to force political reform on the South, a 40 percent Liberal Upper House, we can be certain that it will not happen without opposition.
EVTDESC16010;John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave, but his soul is marching on.'--John Brown's Body, Union Marching song\n\nThe famed hero of the abolitionist movement, the late John Brown, was hanged in Charles Town, Virginia, today after a failed raid on a military armory. Supposedly, Brown had planned to use the arsenal's weapons to arm slaves and incite an open slave rebellion across the entire south. The raid, and John Brown's death, have furthered escalated southern tension over the slavery issue, and in some slave-states there is now even talk of secession from the Union.
EVTDESC16020;Dred Scott, having been a slave, remains a slave' -- Dred Scott v. Sandford\n\nDred Scott, born a slave in Virginia, has, with the help of abolitionist legal advisers, sued his 'owner', claiming that his present residency in a free state requires his emancipation. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that this is, in fact, not the case, and, effectively, that the property rights of slave-owners are protected regardless of where in the Union the slave resides. The case has caused enormous alarm among northern abolitionists, who see it as the first step to a full extension of the institution of slavery to the whole Union.
EVTDESC16030;Clad in her white dress, strolling down the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, her radiance, nobility, and simple beauty turns heads. Speaking, her gentleness, kindness, hospitality and accent -- all draped in the flavors of magnolias, soft cotton and southern verandahs -- do the same. Virtue, honor, and dignity in manifest form, such are the women of the South. A toast, to Dixie!
EVTDESC16040;There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South. Here in this pretty world, Gallantry took its last bow. Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave. Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind... ' -- Gone With The Wind\n\nThe agrarian economy of the southern United States in many ways resembled the roman villa system, or medieval feudalism, with local economic and political power concentrated to the villas and manors of local landholding 'aristocrats', and in this it differed from the more industrialized North. A different sense of life, while not in itself enough to trigger a civil war, had at some point been one foundations upon which the distinctions between Dixies and Yanks were built.
EVTDESC16050;Then I wish I was in Dixie, hooray! hooray!\nIn Dixie Land I'll take my stand to live and die in Dixie,\nAway, away, away down South in Dixie.'\n\n-- Dixie's Land\n\nIt has been speculated that the name 'Dixie', used as a reference to the southern USA, derives from the Mason-Dixon line, defining the border between Maryland, Delaware, (West) Virginia and Pennsylvania. The division between the north and the south, often defined by the Mason-Dixon line, was not just over slavery, it was also one of identity.
EVTDESC160502;Emperor, our officials have detected growing levels of discontent and even hostility towards our Dynasty. This feeling is enflamed by the humiliating presence of the foreign devils in our cities and harbors. How shall we respond?
EVTDESC16060;Yankee Doodle went to town,\nA-Riding on a pony\nHe stuck a feather in his cap,\nAnd called it macaroni.'\n\n--Yankee Doodle\n\nThe term Yankee probably derives from a colonial Dutch nickname for English settlers in New England: 'Janke', meaning 'little Jan'. During the 19th century, the term was often used to denote perceived cultural distinctions between northerners and southerners within the USA itself.
EVTDESC16070;It has put at rest, forever, all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institution.'\n\nHis words are soft-spoken, but carry an inner flame of righteous anger directed at anyone and anything he deems as threatening the institution of slavery. 'Fire-Eaters', radical pro-slavery agitators, have appeared in $PROVINCENAME$
EVTDESC16080;When the sun come back and the first quail calls,\nFollow the Drinking Gourd\nFor the old man's waiting for to carry you to freedom,\nIf you follow the Drinking Gourd.'\n\n-Follow the Drinkin' Gourd\n\nAccording to legend, the song 'Follow the Drinkin' Gourd' was a song written to guide slaves, escaping from slavery in the South to freedom in the North, by telling them to walk in the direction of the 'Drinkin' Gourd', another name for the Big Dipper, a circumpolar asterism that always appears in the northern sky.
EVTDESC16090;A secret society dedicated to promoting perceived southern interests in the United States, by the expansion of slavery, The Knights of The Golden Circle have established a chapter in $PROVINCENAME$. We could attempt to suppress the society, but that would be perceived as an assault on our republican traditions by the local populace.
EVTDESC16100;Founded in 1833, the American Anti-Slavery Society was an organization on the forefront of the American abolitionist movement. With notable members such as Frederick Douglass and Abby Kelley Foster, the society organized meetings, speakings and even published a weekly newspaper between 1840 and 1870, all with the aim of abolishing slavery in the United States. The society has now opened a charter in $PROVINCENAME$. We could attempt to prevent the charter from forming, but that would be perceived as an assault on our republican traditions.
EVTDESC16110;We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.' -- The Declaration of Independence, 1776\n\nThe dank locale is dimly lit, and reeks of sweat and unwashed bodies. Cramped walls, littered with chains and ropes, tell tales of the trade that goes on in this auction house. One by one, blacks are shoved unto a small stage to stand, their hands tied, while the auctioneer calls out the bids. Here, human beings are herded like cattle to be sold into involuntary servitude, serfdom, and slavery.
EVTDESC16120;An extensive tract, describing the purported unconstitutionality of slavery, is being widely disseminated in $PROVINCENAME$. Allowing its continued circulation might upset the lower classes -- where it has seen its widest circulation -- but attempting to curtail distribution will definitely be regarded as an attack on freedom of speech, which will anger the districts big-wigs. Shall we try to curtail the distribution?
EVTDESC16130;Where am I!?', he wakes up screaming. Upon being told that he was found collapsed just a few yards north across from the $STATENAME$ border, he starts laughing. It's a calm laugh, interrupted only by the occasional cough. - '$STATENAME$. I'm in $STATENAME$. Oh merciful Lord, I'm in $STATENAME$!' The man is a slave, escaped from some or other plantation down South of Mason-Dixon. He's wounded, but still alive. What perils he has suffered on his way to $PROVINCENAME$, only the good Lord knows. Federal law mandates that he be returned to his owner.
EVTDESC16140;The Underground Railroad was an informal network, run by abolitionists of varying creeds and colors, dedicated to helping slaves escape from the southern slave-states to freedom in the North. We have every reason to believe that $PROVINCENAME$ has recently developed into a hotbed of Railroad activity. We could put pressure on local politicians to combat their activities, but only at the risk of stirring up abolitionist sentiments in the North.
EVTDESC16150;The 'Copperheads' were a group of Democrats in the Northern United States who, during the Civil War, opposed the war, and favored a peace settlement with the South. The moniker came originally from Unionists likening them to poisonous snakes, but it soon struck home with the Copperheads themselves. While there is no war yet, there is staunch resistance to abolitionism within some democratic circles in $PROVINCENAME$. Stepping up the local political campaigning could probably neutralize them, but only at the cost of offending southern sentiments.
EVTDESC16160;Founded by W.L. Garrison in 1831, The Liberator was one of the most famous abolitionist newspapers in the United States before the Civil War. Although the circulation only ever peaked at a few thousand copies per issue, the paper still received wide notoriety on account of its unwavering advocacy of the abolitionist cause. The Liberator has just published another issue, and the slavery debate has further intensified.
EVTDESC16170;Slave Power was a term used to describe the political power of the landed, slave-owning 'aristocrats' of the Southern USA. Many Northern politicians saw slavery first and foremost not as an issue of mistreatment of blacks, but as something profoundly opposed and contrarian to the republican ideals laid out in the founding documents of the United States, and, thus, a threat more to the nation's civic virtues than to anything else. Today the Southern senators blocked a bill in the House of Representatives. While in itself unimportant, the blocking of the bill has revealed the strength of the Southern states in American politics.
EVTDESC16180;During the most intense days of the slavery debate, some abolitionists organized emigration to the territories of Kansas and Nebraska in order to prevent these territories from being admitted into the Union as slave-states. The theory of popular sovereignty held that a democratic vote in the state would decide on whether the state should be constituted as slave or free. These abolitionists were called Free Staters, and some of them have now turned up in $STATENAME$.
EVTDESC16190;The flames lick the log cabins and wooden houses, throwing a queer orange glow up at a starry night sky, only slightly obscured by the plumes of smoke billowing up from the town. He rides down Main Street, with strange shadows dancing about him as he goes. 'Come out, come out, wherever you are!', he screams. Far away in the city, gunshots echo against the screams of dying men. Border Ruffians, intent on making $STATENAME$ a slave-state, have crossed the border into $PROVINCENAME$ and raided a small outlaying settlement in the territory.
EVTDESC16200;Border Ruffians and Free-Staters are skirmishing over the issue of slavery in $PROVINCENAME$, and the events have started to rack up a death toll. The conflicts will be known to posterity as Bleeding $STATENAME$, raising national awareness over the slavery issue.
EVTDESC16210;$STATENAME$ Border Ruffians in have conducted a raid on a small settlement in $PROVINCENAME$, aiming to drive abolitionist supporters out of $STATENAME$. The casualties number in the hundreds, and the events will be recorded for posterity as the $PROVINCENAME$ War.
EVTDESC16220;The balance of power between Free-Staters and Border Ruffians in the territories has repercussions for the entire Union. To advance the abolitionist cause, an Emigrant Aid Company has opened in $STATENAME$ to help bring in abolitionist Free-Staters to settle in the territories. We can expect a heavy increase in Free-Stater settlements in the future.
EVTDESC16230;The loosely organized band centered around Clarke Quantrill have struck against the Free-Stater settlement in $PROVINCENAME$ raising and burning it. The $PROVINCENAME$ massacre is only one in a long string of events in the ongoing conflict between pro-slavery bushwhackers and abolitionist Free-Staters in $STATENAME$.
EVTDESC16240;The one hundred men of the Pottawatomie Rifles, an abolitionist militia operating in the territories, have struck against the Border Ruffians in $PROVINCENAME$, eliminating their settlement.
EVTDESC16250;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. In fact, all over $STATENAME$ there is talk of secession, as fewer and fewer feel that a meaningful compromise, protecting that 'peculiar institution' -- i.e. Slavery -- of the South, can be reached in a climate where Congress moves increasingly toward a position of favoring political reform.
EVTDESC16300;Harriet Beecher Stove's novel 'Uncle Tom's Cabin', first published in 1852, is one of the most widely read anti-slavery novels ever written. So large was it's perceived impact on the growing national consciousness over the issue of slavery that Abraham Lincoln, upon meeting Stove at the start of the Civil War, is reported as having greeted her: 'So this is the little lady who made this big war.' The publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin has increased national consciousness over the slavery issue.
EVTDESC16310;In a ruling delivered today, the Supreme Court has decided that the slaves involved in the violent rebellion aboard the Spanish schooner 'Amistad' of 1839, later apprehended near Long Island, New York, were merely, in light of the outlawing of the trans-atlantic slave trade, acting in defense of their personal liberty. The case is viewed as a landmark victory for the abolitionist movement, and public awareness over the slavery issue is rising.
EVTDESC16400;Yesterday morning we received a petition from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Congress, requesting Statehood in the United States. A state constitution has been submitted, along with maps defining the state's territorial boundaries. Common opinion seems to hold it a forgone conclusion that we will accept this petition for statehood, and forever join $FROMCOUNTRY$ into our glorious republic.
EVTDESC16410;The waters around our coastlines are open for shipping once again, and we no longer suffer the constricting grip of Scott's Great Snake. Rejoice!
EVTDESC16415;The Ku Klux Klan, abbreviated 'The KKK', was a decentralized organization primarily composed of white southerners, formed in 1865 by Confederate war veterans from Tennessee. A secret vigilante group, known for its iconic symbolism of burning crosses and white hoods and robes, the KKK was formed in opposition to the tenets of Republican Reconstruction, dedicated to preserving white supremacy in the former Confederate states. The Klan shunned few means in accomplishing its goal, and violence directed at southern republicans and blacks was rule rather than exception. The Klan was suppressed by the Federal Government by the passing of the Force Acts of 1871, during the first term of Ulyssess S. Grant. Today we received news that burning crosses have been seen, blazing against the warm, dark night skies of the South.
EVTDESC16420;With the influx of settlers into the Black Hills area, conflicts with the local Sioux have escalated. Today, news reached us from the frontier that a massive War Party, led by an indian whose name reports give only as 'Sitting Bull', has risen up in the Dakota territory.
EVTDESC16430;Sitting Bull and his braves have surrendered, and the Sioux have been defeated. While there will be future battles between the tribes and ourselves, the sharp edge of the Sioux nation has now dulled. Never again will the Sioux be able to muster a force of even comparable size, and the Sioux nation's future will be resigned to the reservations. It is with some sense of mourning that we see the passing of this once great nation into the history books of our young republic.
EVTDESC16440;The New Mexico Apache, led by a man calling himself Victorio, have risen up and massacred several settlers in the state. Provoked by the ever increasing incursions by the white man into territory traditionally considered a part of the Apache homeland, Victorio and his band refuse to submit to United States' authority.
EVTDESC16450;The renowned Apache outlaw Geronimo has surrendered today, to Captain Henry Lawton of The Army, with his small, tattered band of Apache men, women and children. With Geronimo's surrender, the last shred of Apache resistance in the West has died out, and this once proud Indian nation can now be considered pacified. Geronimo will, many years from now, on his deathbed, confess to a nephew that he always regretted the decision to surrender.
EVTDESC170;For if we are to set ourselves and our brethren free from the devastating tribulations and degenerations of alcohol and alcoholism, nothing serves us better than complete and total abstinence, always. What good would it do us to be free of our capitalist oppressors, only to find ourselves soon oppressed by the twin tyrannies of vice and ugly habits?'\n\nSince the negative effects of widespread alcoholism have hit the poorest classes the hardest, the temperance league has managed to find allies for itself within the socialist movement. Local labour agitators in one of our states are arguing against the use of alcohol.
EVTDESC17000;...we will not accept our situation anymore, we will not stand back, we will not remain silent! Give women the right to vote!'\n\nThe development of liberal and feminist thought during the past years have caused women in $COUNTRY$ to form suffragette organizations, demanding that the state accord them legal equality with men. All across $COUNTRY$, women are leaving their primary roles as housewives and caretakers, demanding the right to vote, to work, and to own property.
EVTDESC17010;A small group of women have organized an international convention on the subject of women's rights. The two-day $CAPITAL$ Convention has been held, with both men and women attending, but with the first day's proceedings reserved for the ladies, and with the second day devoted almost exclusively to political tactics. Although there was no unanimity between the delegates, the convention has nevertheless decided to adopt ten resolutions which, taken together, demand that women be accorded equality in matters of Family Law, Education, Property Rights, Jobs, Religion, and Morals.
EVTDESC17020;The subject of woman's Suffrage has come into national focus at the $CAPITAL$ Anti-Slavery Convention, held just the other day in $CAPITAL$, $COUNTRY$. With several international delegates present, some of whom women, a motion was put before the convention that female delegates, while they should be heard before the chamber, should ultimately be denied the right to vote on any resolutions to be adopted by the convention. The seating arrangements alone have become an issue, as men and women at the convention sit segregated. It is becoming ever more obvious that women in $COUNTRY$, and the entire Western world, are increasingly striving to partake in public discourse and debate.
EVTDESC17030;With the war dragging on, and more and more of our able-bodied young men being called up for military service, several leading industrialists have suggested that we tap the productive energies of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ womanhood, and rotate women into temporary employment in the factories. This policy, so say the learned of industry, has already been proven successful in several small-scale attempts, where women have been found to be nowhere near the slow learners that common wisdom had otherwise made them out to be. Apparently, they are quite capable of handling the tasks assigned to them in a factory environment. The age of wonders is not past, it seems.
EVTDESC17040;And, it is therefore my conclusion, that although there are certain professions generally unsuitable for women to occupy, their presence in the work place poses no fundamental threat to the social order.'\n\nA well-known and respected member of our military establishment has, today, published an opinion editorial in the $CAPITAL$ Courier, one of $COUNTRY$'s leading dailies. In what has been described as the biggest career blunder in the decade, the general has advocated the inclusion of women in the work place, in factories and businesses, arguing primarily that their inclusion and protection under law would only amount to a confirmation of the already established de facto state of women being employed.
EVTDESC17050;The $CAPITAL$ weather did its worst against us: mud, mud, mud, was its prominent feature, and it was known among us afterwards as the mud march.'\n\nA female suffragette commented the elements during the Mud March, a demonstration march which, just this past week, attracted over 3,000 women from various organizations, female textile workers, temperance advocates, artists and many other, all coming together in a show of force for Woman's Liberation and Suffrage, on $CAPITAL$'s streets. A gay enough procession by most accounts, despite the weather.
EVTDESC17060;Suffragettes, picketing a local bar in one of our provinces, are becoming the laughing stock of the entire state. The sight of the two, relatively frail, upper class women, standing with their placards outside the bar, picketing for Woman's Suffrage and temperance, is not only being made into an object of ridicule, it is also causing some anger among the lower classes, who feel that the well-offs, the high-and-mighties and the holier-than-thous are trying to patronize (or matronize, as the case may be) them with sophistry and rhetoric.
EVTDESC17070;Like many nascent political ideologies, the early suffragette movements were not foreign to in-fighting and organizational splits over issues of tactics and perceived ideological differences, the split between the NUWSS and the NSWRV in Britain being a poignant example. The suffragette movement in $COUNTRY$ is experiencing somewhat of a setback, on account of an organizational split. 
EVTDESC17080;A married woman owns no personal property, and her legal identity ceases to exist as husband and wife are joined in one person under law and marriage. We want to change this, we want women to be able to dispose of their own property as they wish. We want the courts of law to recognize a husband and wife as two separate legal entities.'\n\nThe suffragette movement in $COUNTRY$ has organized a rally in one of our states, campaigning for the right of women to receive recognition of the rights, deeds and titles of property that they in many cases already, de facto, hold.
EVTDESC17090;We covered the entire city. Me and the girls split up, met at the corner of Main St. and 3rd, and then went off to each try to cover a block or two. It was hard work, but I remember it as a happy time.'\n\n$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Suffragettes have undertaken a leaflet campaign in one of our states, in order to gain traction for their cause. All around the city, women can be seen wearing placards and handing out leaflets asking for support for a whole host of suffragette causes: From property, to marriage, to domestic law to the vote and beyond.
EVTDESC17100;If you, sir, is upset by the fact that Student No. 156 wears a bonnet, I would be pleased to remove my conspicuous headgear and take a seat at the rear of the classroom, but I  will not voluntarily absent myself from a lecture.'\n\nWoman causes scandal at a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ university, by being there. A woman has enrolled at one of our institutions of higher learning, and the event has caused a fair amount of scandal among local conservatives.
EVTDESC17110;Although some women try zealously to incarnate this essence, it is hardly patentable. It is frequently described in vague and dazzling terms that seem to have been borrowed from the vocabulary of the seers, and indeed in the times of St Thomas it was considered an essence as certainly defined as the somniferous virtue of the poppy.'\n- de Beauvoir, Simone -- The Second Sex\n\nA renowned $COUNTRY_ADJ$ suffragette has published a book on what can best be described as the subject of feminist theory, and the book is gaining a fair amount of attention both nationally and internationally.
EVTDESC17120;So I ask you, sisters, write! Write to your congressman, your local MP, your grandmother, someone, anyone! If the world will not come around to the message that women, considered as political animals, are equal to men in every relevant aspect, then the message will have to come around to it!'\n\nThe $COUNTRY_ADJ$ suffragette movement has initiated a letter campaign with the ambitious goal of reaching every MP with a thousand letters every year, until female suffrage is passed, and women are given the right to vote. The campaign has had a fair amount of effect already.
EVTDESC17130;Four broken windows, attempted arson, technical assault of two police officers... The police officers weren't hurt, but I bet their pride was. What in the world compelled you to do such a thing?'\n\nA more militant wing of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ suffragette movement has conducted a violent protest campaign against government authorities in one of our states. Local conservatives speak gloomily about the unraveling of the nation's moral fabric, and the end of Western Civilization.
EVTDESC17140;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ suffragette, jailed on account of violent protesting during a rally, has gone on a two week hunger strike in one of our states' prisons, protesting $COUNTRY$'s supposedly poor treatment of its women. The strike is carried out under the slogan 'Votes for women', and the case has made woman's suffrage the focal point of the local political debate, with every newspaper left, right and center reporting on the case.
EVTDESC17150;The (so-called) Cat and Mouse Act was an infamous British law passed in 1912 in order to combat the suffragette tactic of using hunger strikes as a means to build sympathy for the Suffragette cause. The law stated that a person could be released from jail to recover from any serious illness, only to be jailed again on recovery, thereby washing the government's hands of any harm caused to the woman in question by the hunger strike. A similar ordinance has found its way into the legislature of one of our states, where suffragette hunger strikes are handled in this exact same way.
EVTDESC17160;A small study circle, dedicated to several issues close to the suffragette agenda for woman's votes, has, during the last few years, begun developing a name for itself in the international debate on Woman's Rights. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ School, as the circle is now being known, has published several tracts on philosophy, politics and economics, all relating to the plight of women all across the world.
EVTDESC17170;While Woman's Suffrage has been achieved in $COUNTRY$, many other countries still lack the wonders of a modern, egalitarian democracy. From time to time, in a debate, or at an international conference, it might be good to point this out to other countries, or use it as an argument to calm tensions on the homefront.
EVTDESC17500;Hell no, we won't go!'\n\nOne of our states has seen a surge in socialist agitation during the past few months, since the forming of a labour union at one of the local workshops. The workshop seems to have set a local example to other workplaces, and, now, labour appears to be organizing at every mill, workshop and factory in the entire state. The government has been approached by a group of concerned members of the local elite, who call upon the central government to dispatch national guard units to the province in order to ensure that order is maintained.
EVTDESC17510;Screams can be heard from a workplace in one of our states, where socialist agitators have turned an ongoing labour conflict from bad to worse. Local capitalists are appalled at the liberties these revolutionaries allow themselves with regards to how, when and where they preach their revolutionary ideology, and are considering forming a citizen guard, should the situation escalate further.
EVTDESC17520;A factory in one of our states has become the target of a mild, but costly, sabotage campaign during the past few weeks, and local management suspects that a know socialist agitator in the area is responsible for this development, as the gentleman in question is known by management to have taken issue with a decision they recently took regarding company internal division of labour.
EVTDESC17530;A strike today in one of our states, initiated by communist troublemakers and revolutionaries, was swiftly put down by local police. The event has caused a massive backlash against the socialist movement in the state, as local farmers & peasants perceive the red ideology as being vehemently opposed to the traditions and histories of civilization in general, and , $COUNTRY$, more importantly.
EVTDESC17540;Workers in a machine shop in one of our states have gone out in strike, protesting all manner of ills, real or perceived, in society as a whole and in the workplace. What is infinitely worse than a few redbeards taking a few days off, however, is that many other workers from all across the state have joined them in a state-wide sympathy strike, causing the productive engine of the state to grind to a more or less immediate halt. Harsh methods might have to be employed to resolve this little situation.
EVTDESC17550;A new daily with no shame about its political leanings has been incorporated in $CAPITAL$, The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Red Star, official party organ for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ socialist party. The Red Star publishes deeply moving social commentary, seldom without picturesque little reports on the conditions of working men and women across the world. The Red Star stands, or so it claims, for international solidarity, worker's rights, unionism and class struggle on a broad, democratic and socialist basis.
EVTDESC17560;The red banners flutter before the winds, and people of all ages come out to watch, as socialists, communists, union members and workers of all ages come together in a protest march, all across country, commemorating the deaths of several demonstrators at the Chicago Haymarket Massacre in 1886. While an annually returning celebration in almost every city in $COUNTRY$, this year's incarnation has been particularly successful in one of our states, where an upsurge in socialist militancy and consciousness can be expected.
EVTDESC17570;Extra extra! Grand strike in $CAPITAL$. Workers demand higher wages. Extra extra! Grand strike in...'\n\nA socialist newspaper named 'Forward!' has been published in $CAPITAL$. It reports about various strikes, current news and socialist movements in politics both close to home and abroad.
EVTDESC17580;There's foxes in the hen house,'\ncows out in the corn.\nThe unions have been busted,\ntheir proud red banners torn'\n- Steve Earle\n\nCapitalists in one of our states have begun employing union busting tactics to end what they describe as 'the scourge of organized labour'. By employing professional infiltrators to get under the skin of the state's labour movement, the capitalists hope to be able to sow discontent among the union rank and file.
EVTDESC17590;Capitalists in one of our states have called a lockout following a period of intensifying labour conflicts in the area. Workers have been informed by management that no one is welcome back to work while union sympathies still run high among the employed. Local police have expressed support for the move, citing a long series of disturbances at the factory, some even bordering on sabotage.
EVTDESC17600;The socialist party in one of our states has recently begun undergoing a distinct metamorphosis, under the influence of its young, charismatic leader. While the party still maintains several core tenants of socialism, such as the emphasis on the state's important societal role, it has also begun embracing an aggressive and bombastic form of radical nationalism. Black flags have begun waving from the socialist party headquarters in one of our states, and while still prefixed with 'proto-', it is clear that what we are seeing is the formation of a radical new front in the state's politics: Fascism.
EVTDESC17610;The emerging fascist party in one of our states has formed a paramilitary corps, organized with a military command chain, ideologically coherent and ready to do the bidding of the fascist party leaders. The group is colloquially referred to as the 'Blackshirts' from the iconic militaresque shirts that they have taken to wearing. This trend is new to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ politics, and some fear that it might lead to a chain-reaction, with other parties forming military organizations of their own.
EVTDESC17620;The fascist party has begun organizing soup kitchens for the unemployed in one of our states, citing the need to 'Protect and preserve the pureborn $COUNTRY_ADJ$ industrial workers from the ravages of international capitalism'. Several other parties, along with leading liberal and conservative dailies, have expressed sharp criticism of the party's work, claiming that it, in the end, amounts to little less than bribery and the buying of voter support. The fascists themselves do not seem overly concerned about these accusations.
EVTDESC17630;Reports have reached $CAPITAL$ that the Blackshirts, the paramilitary wing of the fascist party, have begun marching down the country, toward $CAPITAL$, intent on seizing power in $COUNTRY$. The military has thus far not attempted to intervene, and we suspect that this might be due to the fact that several leading members of our armed forces have fascist sympathies themselves. This is definitely a crisis for the young $COUNTRY_ADJ$ democracy.
EVTDESC17640;War veterans, disgruntled with what they see as the failures of capitalism and liberal democracy, have formed a Free Corps -- an ideological an paramilitary organization ostensibly existing to protect the state and homeland, while de facto promoting a fascist political agenda -- in one of our states. The corps has already begun flexing its muscles in local politics, threatening several liberal politicians and maintaining a fairly intimidating uniformed presence in the state.
EVTDESC17650;A fascist newspaper has begun circulating in one of our states. The paper, '$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Dawn', carries fiery denunciations of everything between heaven and earth, including, but certainly not limited to, communists, socialists, liberals, conservatives, foreigners, minorities, women, homosexuals, capitalists, deviants and criminals. While the paper carries a fair amount of vitriol, it does still manage to capitalize fairly well on several of the attitudes that are prevalent among fairly broad strata of our society, whatever that says about $COUNTRY_ADJ$ society.
EVTDESC17660;Political violence has claimed several lives in one of our states, as fascist paramilitaries stormed the headquarters of the local liberal party yesterday, killing three and wounding several more. The action has been met with reaction during the night, as fascists, socialists and citizen guards engage in street-fighting throughout. The situation has exploded out of a relative calm, and many of the citizens in the state are angry, afraid and concerned about where the country is heading, with several suggesting increased police budgets as a means to ensure state control.
EVTDESC17670;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fascist party has embarked on a political propaganda campaign, denouncing everything that they consider to be foreign influences on $COUNTRY$, particularly targeting minorities and immigrants. The party campaign appeals to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ xenophobia, and agitates, sotto voce, for the expulsion of those immigrants from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state. Several leading intellectuals have denounced the campaign as inflammatory, and have expressed support for our national minorities.
EVTDESC17680;Fascists have taken to the streets of one of our states in a show of force for the party and its various sub-organizations. Clad in their black and brown shirts, marching in military order through the streets, drums beating, the fascists are an intimidating sight to behold. Several members of our cabinet are suggesting that the presence of, what effectively amounts to, military units not under state control is becoming more and more of an issue, and are suggesting we outlaw paramilitary organizations.
EVTDESC17690;The fascist party in one of our states is in the process of rising up in open revolution, as news reach us today that they have set up headquarters in a local beer hall, and have read, from its stairs, a declaration of a takeover of state and government functions in the state. Our cabinet is divided on how to handle the situation, but there seems to be some consensus that the local police should be quite capable of handling the situation once they mobilize. Others argue that the revolt must be put down with every available means. Doing the latter risks building support for the fascist cause among those already disgruntled with our rule.
EVTDESC17700;The fascists in one of our states have organized an anti-socialist trade union, dedicated to promoting what it calls 'the organic relationship between labour and capital', under a more general corporativist umbrella. The union is directly subordinate to the fascist party, and has reportedly already been able to scrounge up quite an impressive membership list. We can attempt to suppress this organization, but that risks driving workers to the socialist trade unions instead.
EVTDESC180;Quiet, boys, just a few more seconds. Once that guardie there looks away we'll sneak across the border. There are a thousand thirsty throats in $CAPITAL$ who just ordered a glass from these here casks.'\n\nProhibition has created a lucrative market in the gin running business. From neighboring countries, and from secret, underground breweries and distilleries everywhere, an army of unseen works around the clock to bring the public the finest choices of paint thinners, wood spirits and moonshine. Police have received news that a shipment of illegal alcohol will be entering one of our states tonight.
EVTDESC18000;... and what, with the people desperately clamoring for reform and social justice, hunger riots and class struggle, has our party done to aid the cause of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ workers? Nothing, save the continual reassurance of the eventual fulfillment of vague promises! Colleagues, for these reasons, and many more, I, for one, can no longer consider myself a liberal, except in the true sense of the word: a socialist.'\n\nA block of radical members of the Upper House have defected to form a socialist block, agitating for social reform, equality and worker's solidarity. We could put pressure on the party group to maintain cohesion within its ranks.
EVTDESC18010;Social democracy is democracy in name only. While the party still struggles to maintain illusions, it is long since abundantly evident to any sincere observer that it has come to leave the parliamentary order for a devolution into stale mass-action, rigid dogma and  nepotism. When the levee breaks, let the people know that some stood against the tide.'\n\nA clique of disgruntled within the Upper House have realigned themselves in opposition to socialist refusals to enact political reforms. By exerting political pressure, we can affect the make-up of this new opposition.
EVTDESC18020;... and, yet, it has been said by our self-professed conservatives that the lower classes are unfit -- on account of deficiencies in education, and moral and social understanding -- to have representation. I present to the chamber that this is nothing save base confusion over hen and egg. For if it were ordained by providence that these classes had long since been represented in this noble chamber, then, perhaps, those deficiencies might not still be left unmended to fester.'\n\nA rousing speech in the Upper House today has led to several defections to the liberal faction over the issue of charter reform. The public outcry for universal suffrage continues to grow.
EVTDESC18030;... so you see, my dear old friend, that we need your support in the Upper House in order for the motion to carry.'\n\nLiberals in the Upper House have been conducting a charm offensive, directed at 'swing voters' of the other parties, mustering support in the Upper House for a rescinding of the ban on public meetings. The campaign has met with some success, and we need to decide on what to do about it.
EVTDESC18040;...I've seen the red banners on the streets of $CAPITAL$, and I believe that the only way to combat the rising tide of socialism is through a policy of accommodation.'\n\nA group of reform-minded liberals in the Upper House have decided to cast their lots with the socialist agenda with regards to the issue of trade-union reform. The group, claiming that our present policies allow public opinion too little sway, and arguing that labour reform is needed to protect worker's interests, is organizing to form a parliamentary block. Should we pull some strings in parliament to counter-act this move?
EVTDESC18050;... so it is now, with renewed force, that I restate that conundrum of mine which is yet to garner any sort of response from this chamber: What is to be done about the issue of the press reform? Me, and many colleagues with me, have long argued that the time for reform is now, yet this session has remained entirely unwilling to commit to even an answer, much less a policy.'\n\nReform-minded MPs in parliament have reformed in a new coalition to push the agenda for press reform. Capitalizing on popular sentiment for freedom of expression, the liberals are gaining strength in the Upper House.
EVTDESC18060;Which is why we have only a resounding 'No' to offer the propositions of further reforms! We came here with a platform of limited reform, but we now hear talk of reforms that threaten to overthrow every sacred and long established institution of this land, ultimately threatening to unravel the very fabric of our society.'\n\nDisgruntled by the prevailing political winds, an unholy alliance between members of several factions in the Upper House have coalesced into one block dedicated to opposing all further efforts at fundamentally reforming the political system.
EVTDESC18070;...anyone opposed?'\n\nDuring a hastily called extraordinary session of the Upper House, a curious motion for constitutional reform has been passed. The reform proposes a system with a party appointed upper house, and the move has all the hallmarks of a putsch by the already ruling reactionary party.
EVTDESC18080;A debate on wage slavery has taken hold in the Upper House, and the socialist party is gaining traction by arguing the need for wage reform. The broad popular support for further social reforms has lead to several nominally non-socialist members of the house finding themselves increasingly pressed by their home constituencies to push for further reforms, causing some of them to consider crossing the aisle over to the socialist block. Through political maneuvering, we could probably avoid massive defections to the socialists, but this would probably be seen as an autocratic move by broad stratas of our country's population.
EVTDESC18090;The Liberal caucus has convened to further press the agenda for political reform. Citing concerns about alleged infringements of the state apparatus into the private lives of citizens, and a political system firmly lodged in the hands of the few at the expense of the many, the liberals have threatened to block all bills from passing the Upper House until their concerns have been addressed. A few members of other parties are considering aligning themselves with the liberals on the issues of political reform, and any delay on our part will most likely serve to further increase popular frustration over the slow pace of reform.
EVTDESC18100;...it seems to me, therefore, a defect in our much lauded system that the lowliest workers can not even afford for themselves and their next of kin the bare minimums of sanitary living. The grimy, soot-ridden hovels, huddling under the shadows of the soot-stacks springing up like mushrooms after a rain storm, are damp and dark breeding grounds for cholera, tuberculosis and immorality. A limited health reform, dear colleagues, would go far in amending these problems.'\n\nThe Upper House is in turmoil over it's apparent inability to pass social reform, despite mounting public demands.
EVTDESC18110;I believe it possible that an agreement can be concluded.'\n\nA temporary Upper House Majority has formed on the issue of Unemployment Subsidies. Speaking in parliament, the conservative group leader has opined that he believes that the measures can be enacted, as an experiment with national policy, if nothing else. Citing fears of public discontent with the present plight of the unemployed, his group will back a proposal for modest unemployment benefits. Liberals in parliament remain wholly unconvinced of the proposition, but not enacting the proposal will be seen as a lost opportunity by those pushing for reform.
EVTDESC18120;I believe therefore that the only natural solution to the present polylemma is to argue in favor of my conservative colleagues on these issues.'\n\nThe strong popular support, combined with rising militancy, for a conservative national policy has led to friction in the Upper House. Several liberal members of parliament are considering defection to the conservative faction, and only ham-handed use of the party whip could possibly keep the liberals in their places.
EVTDESC18130;A red wind seems to have taken a tour-de-force through the Upper House lately, as more and more members of parliament express their willingness to cooperate with, and support the ruling socialist party. If we do not wish to see the socialists achieving a single majority in the chamber, now is the time to act.
EVTDESC18140;The Falange is asserting its power both on the streets and in the upper house. Several conservative members of parliament are -- by hook or by crook -- considering defections to the fascist faction, and preventing these reshufflings will doubtlessly lead to an increase in fascist militancy.
EVTDESC18150;The small liberal party is using the social unrest in $COUNTRYNAME$ for political purposes, attempting to turn some of the more left leaning conservatives in the Upper House to their cause. The issue on the table is voting reform, and some conservatives are considering supporting the liberal party over the issue.
EVTDESC18160;And I believe therefore that freedom, shall it not perish from this realm, needs our constant vigilance on its behalf.\n\nA liberal member of the Upper House has held a rousing speech in parliament, criticising the government for what he claims is its failure to amend the rising tide of social unrest in the country. How should the government respond?
EVTDESC18170;A socialist demagogue in the Upper House has launched a long tirade against the government from the speaker's podium, ridiculing the government for what he calls its inability to quell the increasing social unrest in $COUNTRYNAME$. He claims that, under a socialist regime, the leadership, the party and the masses speak as if with one voice.
EVTDESC18180;And it seems altogether pleasing, therefore, that the order long established shall prevail, throughout the centuries, throughout the eras, and today.' A conservative member of the Upper House has addressed parliament today with a lionizing speech to the nation and its manifold glories.
EVTDESC18190;A reactionary member of the Upper House has addressed the house today, speaking of the need to take back that land which is legitimately and since time immemorial our eternal birth right.
EVTDESC18200;...that our traders and merchants have an unrestricted right to the free roam over sea and land, and that no government has the right to interfere therewith.'\n\nA charismatic young member of the Upper House from the anarcho-liberal faction has agitated for a strong policy of free-trade, and people seem to listen to him. We can take this opportunity to push the agenda for laissez faire, or we can anger his supporters by simply ignoring the speech.
EVTDESC18500;Today, in cities all across $COUNTRYNAME$, the forces of law and order marched through streets decorated in the colors of their uniforms, showing to all and everyone their continued commitment to maintaining their calm and steadfastness in a hysterical era. The police agencies have also requested a further direction for their work. How do we make the most of this event?
EVTDESC18510;Our nation may be broken, but our army is not. In their eyes as they parade through the streets can be seen nothing but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$, and the ideals for which our nation stands. These men, and the description fits them, have been fostered since childhood into rigid and firm belief in our nation, and they would die to defend it. Long live $COUNTRYNAME$!
EVTDESC18520;As the soldiers depart from lodgings and barracks to go off, as young men are want to do, to fight and bleed in the great war, their closed marching columns are saluted on their ways by women and children of all ages, standing along roadsides and on railway stations, sending them off with kisses and smiles, and decorating their weapons with flowers.
EVTDESC18530;In the workshops and mills of our country, the free $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people make daily discoveries and advances. The advancement of science is intimately tied to the free exchange of ideas, and nowhere is the exchange freer than in $COUNTRY$. Our liberty makes us a power house of technological progress.
EVTDESC18540;While some of our policies in the past have been viewed as land-grabbing expansionist imperialism, some people, even abroad, are now arguing that we are simply furthering the cause of human liberty by expanding our nation. A foreign friendship association has recently sent us a telegram of warm congratulations on our latest victories. What is the future course of our nation?
EVTDESC18550;As militancy rises in $COUNTRY$, demonstrators take to the streets in $CAPITAL$ to protest the government's policies, calling out for political and economical reform. By dispatching additional police forces to control the situation we can prevent further escalations of violence, but then again, it has always been our nation's tradition that people have the right to make their voices heard. By reaffirming our traditional values, we will look strong in the eyes of the world.
EVTDESC18560;A moment ago, they marched and shouted, cries of desperation and anger echoing through the streets. Now, a calm settles over the scene, as the anger subsides into stillness, and strife dissolves into peace. Whatever else can be said about the ails of our country, for all it's flaws and warts and barely overgrown scabs on old wounds, all people in our nation take an equal share in the toils and hardships, and people know this.
EVTDESC18570;They sweat and bleed, they toil and strive, always forward, furthering our nation's pride and prestige. The men and women of our nation are of a fine pedigree, and the feeling they all share, of being part of a common communion, and of sharing the same destiny, gives them the sense that the extra effort they put in is always rewarded. Our egalitarian values have caused the people of our nation to put in an extra effort this year. What should we have them do?
EVTDESC18580;End the war! Bread for $CAPITAL$'s workers! A farewell to arms!'\n\nDemonstrations have erupted all across $COUNTRYNAME$, calling for an end to the war effort, and a peace treaty with our enemies. Our nation is founded upon the fundamental truth that all men are created equal. They demonstrators see themselves as a part of a greater whole, and they do not exclude even our nation's enemies from this sense of communality.
EVTDESC190;A viticultural association has formed in one of our states, in opposition to perceived excesses of teetotalers and temperance activists. Dedicated to the preservation of what they call the rich $COUNTRY_ADJ$ cultural heritage expressed in the traditions and rituals surrounding alcohol, the Viticultural Association opposes all thoughts of prohibition, and instead advocates responsible drinking.
EVTDESC19000;Our independence is gradually being undercut and more and more becoming something that only exists on paper, as several foreign Great Powers vie for control over our political institutions. Recently, tensions have erupted over their rights to conduct criminal investigations on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. The Great Powers will have to either assert themselves, or lose influence.
EVTDESC19005;Tensions between ourselves and other Great Powers have erupted in $FROMCOUNTRY$ over the issue of criminal investigations. Our position is that we have the right to conduct our own criminal investigations in $FROMCOUNTRY$, without interference from local or foreign authorities. This position is obviously contested by our rivals. Our choice here is to either assert our position, which will be seen as undercutting $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ independence, or fall back, which means losing influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$.
EVTDESC19010;Our nation is one of the most prestigious Great Powers on Earth. From $CAPITAL$ to far flung provinces beyond, our flag flutters proudly in the winds, striking fear into the hearts of anyone who dare oppose us. In celebration of our dominance and just reign, an imperial parade is being planned in $CAPITAL$. The question that now poses itself is: Should we invite foreign dignitaries to this joyous occasion, or shall we simply conclude that no other nation is fit to bask with us in our place in the sun?
EVTDESC19020;The flora of $PROVINCENAME$ is spectacular, unique and mostly unknown to science. Here, in the vast spaces of uncharted land, an untold affluence of botanical riches awaits the discoverer who dares brave the harsh and unforgiving climate in search of it. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Botanical Society is considering sending an expedition to $PROVINCENAME$, but, as is so often the case, funds are lacking. Sending an expedition could further the cause of science, but, beware, we might get competition...
EVTDESC19022;Rumors abound in botanical circles that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has launched a botanical expedition to $FROMPROVINCE$. According to the rumors, the flora of $FROMPROVINCE$ is a veritable cornucopia of beauty and biological diversity. While $FROMPROVINCE$ is a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, we could attempt to send an expedition of our own. It might be frowned upon, but the discoveries we could make do have a strange allure of their own.
EVTDESC19023;The botanical expedition we dispatched some time ago has found itself stranded in Marrakech with a leaking hull and no rations. The expedition leader has sent word home, with a returning ship, requesting additional funds for the continued journey into the heart of darkness. Shall we provide the additional funds?
EVTDESC19024;... and, yet, while some amongst our citizenry can't afford the bare minimums of food and clothing, our government spends wasteful millions on sending expeditions to God-forsaken corners of nowhere in search of colorful flowers!'\n\nA debate has broken out in the Upper House over the botanical expedition that we decided to fund some time ago. Liberals oppose the expenses that the expedition has accrued, claiming that $COUNTRYNAME$ can ill afford such luxuries.
EVTDESC19025;... thus, our expedition has now catalogued an additional 20 species of plantlife hereto unknown to science. During the past months two additional men have been claimed by the foul odors of malaria and dysentery, but, despite absent friends, morale among the men continues to be high. With best wishes, and love. Signed, ... '\n\nThe botanical expedition we dispatched has reported back. It is clear that, while they are making progress, they could use some additional support.
EVTDESC19026;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Botanical Expedition that we dispatched some time ago hasn't been heard from in quite a while. Yesterday, we received a troubling report:\n\n'The camp is deserted. Scattered around the former camp grounds are trace remnants of what I believe to be signs of a struggle. Tracks lead farther away into the vast inhospitable hell beyond. I believe this to be the end of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Botanical Expedition of $YEAR$'\n\nIt seems our expedition has vanished.
EVTDESC19027;The enormous white crown leaves of the flower shines with unrivaled luster. The botanical expedition we dispatched some time ago has returned home with a newly discovered flower. The flower, which is the size of the fist of a full grown man, has quickly become the talk of Europe, as gardeners all across the continent strive to cultivate it. In honor of the rich sponsorships we have provided our expedition the flower has been named 'The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Empress'. Our scientific discovery is the envy of the world.
EVTDESC19028;$FROMCOUNTRY$ announced today that it has located the famed white flower that will henceforth be known as 'The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Empress'. In light of this discovery, our own botanical expedition has very limited outsights of finding anything that will rival the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ discovery. Our expedition has returned home, with limited success.
EVTDESC19029;The streets of $CAPITAL$ were decorated in spring flowers today in celebration of the returning botanical expedition of $YEAR$. The expedition has been an astounding success, having catalogued more than one hundred new species of colonial flora. Our nation can take pride in itself, and know that its efforts have helped further the cause of science!
EVTDESC19030;With the Ottoman Empire fading as a Great Power, people have instead begun referring to this once great nation as 'The Sick Man of Europe'. Nationalism and revolts in the Empire's non-turkish provinces are growing concerns for the Ottoman State, and coupled with the relative backwardness of the Empire in comparison to the states of Western Europe, many now seem to believe that the Empire's demise is only a question of time. Furthermore, the reputed harsh treatment of Christians in the Ottoman State have led to $FROMCOUNTRY$ declaring itself the protector of Eastern Christendom. Should we accept the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ encroachments on Ottoman authority?
EVTDESC19031;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has denied our legitimate assumption of the title of Supreme Authority and Protector of Eastern Christendom within the Ottoman Empire. We can maintain the title in spite of $FROMCOUNTRY$'s protests, but the world would view this as a legitimate reason for war on $FROMCOUNTRY$'s part. If we were to lose a future war against them our new title would be lost.
EVTDESC19032;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to renounce their claims to being the defenders of Eastern Christendom within the Ottoman Empire. We now have a legitimate Casus Belli on them, and a victorious war against them will cause them to lose the title.
EVTDESC19033;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has rescinded their claims to being the defenders of Eastern Christendom within the Ottoman Empire. Hopefully, this means that a war over the issue has been avoided.
EVTDESC19040;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has requested excavation rights in the Valley of The Kings. While we ourselves do not have the know how or money to fund a serious excavation of the area, and allowing a foreign contractor might be good for that reason, it might also be best to let the secrets of our proud nation's history lie undisturbed until such a time when we ourselves can find them. Turning down a foreign power will spoil our relations, though.
EVTDESC19041;The government of Egypt has granted us the exclusive right to excavate and investigate ancient ruins in the Valley of The Kings. The potential discoveries there will prove an enormous opportunity for us to increase our scientific renown in the world.
EVTDESC19042;The government of Egypt has refused to allow us excavation rights in The Valley of The Kings. Our international prestige has been lowered as a result, and relations with Egypt have soured.
EVTDESC19043;Egyptian officials in Alexandria have refused our Egyptian Expedition to unload vital excavation equipment in the Alexandrian port. The Egyptian customs system is a byzantine construction which is nigh on impossible to penetrate without personal pull or money. We could put pressure on the Egyptian government over the issue, but it might be best if the expedition simply bribes its way through Egypt.
EVTDESC19044;Our archeological excavation team working in the Valley of The Kings in Egypt has discovered a tomb from the Eighteenth Dynasty. The tomb is rectangular, and divided into upper and lower pillared sections, with a royal sarcophagus located in the lower section. This fantastic discovery has made our Egyptological department the talk of the historically aware Europe!
EVTDESC19045;How it started, we do not know, but what we do know is that what was once a rumor has now become public wisdom. The rumor that has grown from breeze to storm is that a curse befalls anyone who disturbs the Tombs of the Pharaohs in the Valley of The Kings, and some even claim that our excavation team threatens to draw down the curse on all of $COUNTRY$. It is a hysterical rumor, of course, but the hysteria is there nevertheless.
EVTDESC19046;...opening the inner granite lid leading into the tomb, I was met by a breath of air that had been left undisturbed for some three thousand years. To the best of my knowledge, I was the first to disturb the Pharaoh's sleep since he was laid to rest all those thousand years ago. There, standing in the ancient air of the crypt, I felt the smells of wheat growing on the Nile, perfume in alabaster vases, and a hint of dying papyrus.'\n\nThe most marvellous discovery of the century has been made by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archeologists working in The Valley of The Kings: The previously undiscovered tomb of the 19 year old Pharaoh, Tutankhamun.
EVTDESC19047;Our excavation team working in the Valley of The Kings has uncovered a hereto undiscovered tomb, and the mummified remains of an Egyptian High-Priest of the 19th dynasty. The interior of the tomb is rich in decorations, and the discovery is an enormous success for our Egyptian expedition.
EVTDESC19200;His Majesty the King thereupon refused to receive the Ambassador again and had the latter informed by the Adjutant of the day that His Majesty had no further communication to make to the Ambassador.'\n\nA diplomatic conflict has erupted between France and Germany, following a perceived snubbing of the French ambassador, by the Prussian King, at the Monarch's vacation resort at Bad Ems, Hesse-Nassau, Prussia. Rumors claim that the dispatch might have been purposely engineered by German officials to provoke a war.
EVTDESC19300;Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!' cries she\n' With silent lips. 'Give me your tired, your poor,\nYour huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'\n\nThe people of France have presented to the American people a spectacular gift. An enormous copper statue, 151 ft. tall, depicting a woman carrying a torch, representing and named 'Liberty Enlightening The World'. The design has been carried out by one Frederic Auguste Bartholdi, and a place has been set aside for the statue on an island in the New York harbor. The statue will henceforth be known, simply, as 'The Statue of Liberty'.
EVTDESC19310;The 'Mandate of Heaven' is a concept in Chinese philosophy, similar to the western concept of the divine right of Kings, which has historically been used to both justify and motivate monarchical power. With our recent ascension to Great Power status our subjects have again become convinced that our government enjoys the The Mandate of Heaven.
EVTDESC19320;Japan, land of the rising sun. For many years, since the black ships of the gaijin first appeared on our shores, our nation has been sailing in the wake of powers greater than and beyond our own. With our recent ascension to Great Power status the tides of fortune have turned. From now on let the winds repulse and break any foreign wave that dares wash over the sacred shores of the Great Power of Japan!
EVTDESC19355;Growing nationial pride in countries around the world has reached the point where people will not accept anything less than total victory when Great powers clash. From now on, any conflict with at least two Great powers on each side will be regarded as a Great War!
EVTDESC19356;It has become increasingly clear that we have entered a new era of unprecedented warfare. The conflicts of our time are no longer mere local issues, but instead reach every corner of the world. Considering the ever increasing stakes and the terrifying impact of these hostilities on the nations involved, there is no longer any need for restrain.\n\n From now on a great war will allow a side that is clearly winning the ability to add even more wargoals
EVTDESC19356_NEWS_LONG;It has become increasingly clear that we have entered a new era of unprecedented warfare. The conflicts of our time are no longer mere local issues, but instead reach every corner of the world. Considering the ever increasing stakes and the terrifying impact of these hostilities on the nations involved, there is no longer any need for restrain.
EVTDESC19356_NEWS_MEDIUM;It has become increasingly clear that we have entered a new era of unprecedented warfare. The conflicts of our time are no longer mere local issues, but instead reach every corner of the world. Considering the ever increasing stakes and the terrifying impact of these hostilities on the nations involved, there is no longer any need for restrain.
EVTDESC19356_NEWS_SHORT;It has become increasingly clear that we have entered a new era of unprecedented warfare.
EVTDESC19500;The smouldering remains of a Voortrekker wagon train was discovered by our scouts near the Bushman river a few days ago. In the devastation left after what must obviously have been an attack, we have found the remains of several Afrikaaner men, women and children. Spearheads left at the site tell a clear tale. It appears as if the Impis of the Zulu, to our South-east, is behind the massacre.
EVTDESC19501;Migrants have been moving in large numbers through our colony on the Cape, on their way to the newly incorporated town of 'Johannesburg', on the edge of the Witwatersrand mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place. The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders, and this might be a valid excuse to end the independence of these pesky fringe states.
EVTDESC2000;Foreign immigrants arriving in new countries often find themselves living together concentrated in relatively small areas, living in close proximity to, and seeking mutual support from, their national brethren, often forming little 'ethnic enclaves', such as New York's 'Little Italy'. $PROVINCENAME$ is no exception, as the immigrant community there has formed a just such a thing, complete with all the cultural, linguistic and culinary flavors of the immigrants' homeland
EVTDESC20000;As a great power it is expected of us to assert our position.
EVTDESC2010;It has been twenty days. Twenty days without work, without money, without any chance to feed or clothe my family. Twenty days... Twenty days is an eternity when you have to rummage through the garbage to find something to eat. I don't want to beg, I don't want to steal, but twenty days without work...'\n\nFew immigrants, who left their country to live and work in your country, are able to find work.
EVTDESC20100;Recently the international community has become increasingly aware of the so-called 'plight of the poor oppressed people in $STATE$. It is claimed we have long oppressed them, and that they long to be free from our benevolent rule. We will, of course, brook no interference in our rule of $STATE$.
EVTDESC20102;Dispute over $CRISISAREA$ has now escalated into an international crisis. $CRISISTAKER$ claims the area as an integral part of their nation, while $CRISISTARGET$ denies they have any claim to it and insists the state should remain under their control. At a recent conference on the matter our ambassador made several rather militant remarks that greatly raised the tempers of all present.\nShould we endorse his position, or issue an apology for his actions and disavow his remarks?
EVTDESC20103;The fate of the $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$ people has become a major international crisis recently. While $CRISISTARGET$ currently controls the area, $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$ rebels and patriots are making a major effort to free themselves from $CRISISTARGET_ADJ$ rule. As a Great Power we have of course sent an ambassador to discuss the fate of $CRISISTAKER$, unfortunately he appeared at the latest summit meeting more drunk than usual and proclaimed that we were prepared to settle the issue by giving all other participants a sound thrashing if they don't follow our lead. Naturally this has escalated the situation, although we can still back down by disavowing his actions, but doing so would be most embarrassing.
EVTDESC20104;Dispute over $CRISISAREA$ has now escalated into an international crisis. With Great Powers taking sides on the matter the stakes are suddenly a lot higher, should we attempt to press our claims strongly or try to calm the situation?
EVTDESC20105;With the $CRISISTAKER_ADJ$ rebels struggling to break free from our nation and $CRISISATTACKER$ supporting them, we must hope that the arms of $CRISISDEFENDER$ will be able to support our cause. Should our Ambassador to $CRISISDEFENDER$ ask them to press our case strongly, or hint that we are open to a negotiated settlement?
EVTDESC2020;Romance is in the air in $PROVINCENAME$, where a marriage between one of the province's immigrant sons, and a young local girl, is being celebrated by friends and family. Some decry the development as the end of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ civilization, but the young couple sure do look happy. Immigration is changing $PROVINCENAME$ in ways both big and small.
EVTDESC2030;Anja Yesi-whatnow?'\n'Aniya Yezierska. Is my name unpronounceable?'\n'Kind of. Would you like to change it? It could be difficult for you to get a job otherwise.'\n\nUnpronounceable names and strange spellings could cause trouble for job-seeking immigrants.
EVTDESC2040;The many immigrants who have arrived in the country have created a demand for housing. The construction of new homes must be speeded up when reports show that many immigrants share housing with up to ten or twenty people. This is a minor disaster as this could create epidemics, revolts and other disturbances.
EVTDESC2050;The immigrants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone out in a demonstration, protesting the lack of equal citizenship, and demanding equal recognition under the law for all $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens.
EVTDESC2060;Riots have broken out in $PROVINCENAME$'s immigrant communities. While formally citizens, many immigrants feel that the state does not accord them proper recognition, and that they do not have the same opportunities as proper nationals.
EVTDESC2070;I pledge allegiance, to the flag of $COUNTRY$, and to the government for which it stands'\n\nNot one eye dry in the audience in $PROVINCENAME$ today, as some of our immigrants today took the pledge of allegiance, and confirmed their loyalty to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state.
EVTDESC2080;Immigrants arriving in $COUNTRY$ often have small means both in terms of money and in terms of opportunity. Many of them have wound up in $PROVINCENAME$'s poor quarters, and those quarters are increasingly taking on the characteristics of a ghetto. It could be a good idea to do something about these squalid living conditions, lest they worsen.
EVTDESC2090;Newly arrived immigrants in $PROVINCENAME$ are finding it hard to assimilate into the broader $COUNTRY_ADJ$ populace, and many among the local population have come to view them as an alien presence. Immigrants live in separate areas of the city, go to separate schools and shops, and generally have very little contact with the extended community.
EVTDESC2100;Following an extended period of civil unrest in $PROVINCENAME$, local anti-immigrant sentiments have exploded into a full scale riot. Shop windows have been smashed, and several of the recently arrived have been murdered, as immigrants are blamed for all manner of social ills, real or perceived
EVTDESC21000;One of the most common killers in the 19th century was tuberculosis, an infectious disease in humans that usually targets the lungs. Known today to be caused by various strains of mycobacteria, the historical explanations for tuberculosis range from vampirism to imbalances in the 'cardinal fluids'. Known since ancient times, and first described as a contagious disease by Avicenna in 1020, typical symptoms of the disease include chronic cough, fever, and the expulsion of blood-tinged phlegm. In the 19th century, the disease was sometimes romanticized, as several famous authors and poets of the era were known sufferers.
EVTDESC21010;While epidemic and widespread famine disappeared almost entirely from the Western world with the development of the modern, capitalist, free-market system, and the extensive division of labour employed by it, combined with new advances in agricultural technologies, one of the oldest killers known to man, hunger, was still claiming victims in Europe and the Americas well into the 20th century. Primarily so, of course, among the already poor. Famine has struck one of our states, and we need to react.
EVTDESC21020;Most commonly transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, exasperated by combinations of poor hygiene, cramped living and lacklustre public sanitation, Typhoid fever was one of the major killers of the 19th century. In Chicago alone, 174 deaths per 100,000 was, in 1891, caused by typhoid fever. The disease, which generally starts of as a mild fever, will over the course of a few weeks manifest itself in internal bleedings and delirium, potentially causing death. While improvements in sanitary conditions eventually came to more or less eradicate the disease in the developed world, at least one $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state was nevertheless hit hard in $YEAR$.
EVTDESC21030;The 'Spanish' Flu was an influenza pandemic that killed somewhere between 50-100 million people worldwide between the years 1918 to 1920. Due to increased trade, colonial contacts, commerce and other myriads of global connections that had all increasingly made the world a smaller place throughout the 19th century, the Spanish flu was able to spread quickly across the world in a mere few years. Further aggravated by the on-going first world war, and the cramped living conditions in the trenches, the Spanish flu is one of the first and most terrifying examples of a truly global pandemic. And... come to think of it... haven't you been feeling a bit feverish, lately?
EVTDESC21040;Smallpox, a highly contagious disease caused by the Variola virus, killed approximately 400,000 Europeans per year at the end of the 18th century. Successful vaccination programs undertaken in the 19th and 20th centuries would eventually lead to the disease being classified as eradicated by the WHO in 1979, but that might be a small comfort to the people in that state of yours who, in $YEAR$, suffered hard from an outbreak of, exactly that: Smallpox.
EVTDESC2110;The newly arrived immigrants in $PROVINCENAME$ have brought with them the collected experiences of their home country, and their songs now blend with ours in the ever-changing symphony that is $COUNTRY$. Their customs have enriched our own, and created interesting new blends of cultural expression in the fields of art, science and architecture.
EVTDESC2120;A recent immigrant to $PROVINCENAME$ was put on the returning ship back home again, when local police caught him stealing from a local street vendor. The case has caused much alarm among the local immigrant community, many of whom are unfamiliar with our justice system, who now fear that more deportations will follow.
EVTDESC2130;The immigrants to $PROVINCENAME$ have opened several new shops where specialties from their old homelands can be bought and savored, and this has meant that the local population can, for the first time, experience tastes from parts of the world hereto unknown to them. People who, a mere few years ago, ate the same food as their ancestors had for centuries, can now open their eyes and pallets to the culinary delights of a whole world.
EVTDESC21500;The Tunguska explosion of 1908, which produced a devastating fireball in Siberia that destroyed forests and caused worldwide tremors, was the result of an asteroid or meteor, scientists believe. 
EVTDESC21510;The eruption of the Krakatau volcano and the resultant tsunami left over 36500 dead in the Dutch East Indies, and the sound of the eruption was heard 3000 miles away at Rodrigues Island in the Indian Ocean. The explosion had a tremendous global impact, with the sky darkening worldwide for years afterwards, producing intensely red sunsets and other optical effects, as well as global average temperature dropping by more than a degree Celsius.
EVTDESC21520;A major earthquake has struck San Francisco, California, today, causing widespread devastation and the loss of thousands of lives. Tremors have been reported as far away inland as Nevada, and the fire that erupted as a result of the earthquake has left the city more or less leveled. Army units are hard at work bringing in supplies to the survivors, and we can rest assured that the quake will leave its mark on public memory for generations to come.
EVTDESC22000;The Trustee System, or 'Trusty System', was a corrections system originated in the U.S. state of Mississippi, but also employed in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana and others, under which prison convicts with a record of good behavior (often equated with obedience) were allowed to police other prison inmates in a strict, pseudo-military hierarchy of power, with some inmates, deemed especially trustworthy, even being allowed to carry firearms. For profit convict labor was a corner stone of the system. The trustee system was first employed on the Parchman Farm prison in Mississippi, and was, as the 19th century turned into the 20th, much lauded as a profitable and modern corrections system. Reports of widespread inmate abuses would end the system in the 1970s, but, in $YEAR$, it was all the rage in certain $COUNTRY_ADJ$ states.
EVTDESC22010;The idea of isolating offenders and breachers of the public peace from society in general is probably as old as time itself. Many classical systems of justice included banishment from the realm as a last resort type of punishment, reserved for serious crimes and offences, and such punishment was not seldom considered worse than a death penalty. With the growth of the European colonial empires during the 18th and 19th centuries, these ideas received a modern incarnation in the form of the penal colony, with renowned (or infamous) examples being the British colony at Botany Bay and the French 'Devil's Island' in French Guiana. Since $COUNTRY$ occupies several territories that could be well suited for such a purpose, perhaps we ourselves should consider establishing such institutions?
EVTDESC22011;Since we no longer hold any territories suitable for the purpose, our Penal Colony system has been abolished.
EVTDESC22020;Two dirty day-rooms, and three offensive night-rooms: That for men eight feet square: one of the women's, nine by eight, the other four and a half feet square: the straw, worn to dust, swarmed with vermin: no court: no water accessible to prisoners. The petty offenders were in irons: at my last visit, eight were women.'\n- John Howard\n\nA penal reform league has formed in $COUNTRY$, protesting the miserable conditions in our country's prisons and correctional facilities and institutions. The League argues for single ceiling accommodation policies in prisons, along with several other ideas aiming to improve the cramped living conditions.
EVTDESC22030;$COUNTRY$ is in a state of collective shock, as news broke today of a foul murder committed in one of our states. A young girl working as a prostitute in the state was found brutally battered by a client, and rumor has it that the police are covering up the identity of the murderer, who, it has been claimed, belongs to a rich banking family of some local renown. Police, however, maintain that they are still investigating the matter, but that no perpetrator has yet been located. The affair is on everyone's lips, and the debate has even reached parliament, where liberal MPs demand answers from the government regarding the matter.
EVTDESC22040;Up and down the roads they march, in single narrow defile, carrying with them, wherever they go, the iron chains of unfree men. These people are not slaves, but convicts, and they have been sentenced by courts and magistrates of justice and peace, to work and spill their sweat under the burning sun. They are a common sight in $COUNTRY$, for there are many men like them. Forced labor is, and has long been, one of the most common forms of punishment available to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ courts. Hard work, it has been said, will improve the moral understanding of these cretins, and, therefore, work they do.
EVTDESC22050;A state-wide manhunt has been called in one of our states, as police report that a convicted murderer has escaped from a local prison facility. While unsettling in itself, the news has also brought our nation's prison system to the public spot-light, fueling a national debate on the issues of crime & punishment. Liberals argue that the escape merely serves as further indictment of the dilapidated and tragic state of our nation's prison system, while conservatives point to the natural constraints on the national budget, and argue that we should not spend the better part of our money on what is arguably the worst part of our citizenry.
EVTDESC22060;And then we have this little fellow. Started out with the proverbial pins and needles and pretty soon he was on to robbing banks. He'll be spending the rest of his life here, so we keep him in chains most of the time. I suspect it will drive him insane in a few years, if it hasn't already.'\n\nImprisonment for life, without the possibility of parole, is not an uncommon punishment in $COUNTRY$, however, in certain liberal circles there have been arguments on the nature of crime and punishment lately, with the opinion being advanced that a human being in chains is incapable of being swayed by the angels of his better nature, while kept under miserable conditions. There is a growing movement for a liberalization of the prison laws.
EVTDESC22070;As the 19th century dawned on Europe, the practice of jailing people who defaulted on their debts was still norm. In England, infamous examples of such institutions - Debtor's Prisons - include London's Fleet Prison. In these institutions debtors where not seldom expected to pay for both board and room, and sometimes even special 'Jailor's Fees', to effectively pay their jailors for their upkeep. Often times, these practices only served to further complicate the debtor's financial situation, as it for natural reasons is hard to earn money from inside a prison wall. The system was gradually abandoned in most European countries throughout the 19th century, and London's Fleet Prison was torn down in 1846. A wrongly jailed $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrat is now drawing public attention to these institutions, calling for their abolishment.
EVTDESC22080;A debate in the $CAPITAL$ Reform Club tonight, regarding the death penalty, has seen new arguments advanced from the opponents of the punishment. Focusing in on the irrevocability of the punishment, in tandem with the ever present risk of wrongful sentencing, liberals have joined together to form a Citizen's committee to abolish the sentence. The debate has been caused by the much publicized recent execution of an elderly gentleman convicted of murdering his wife, despite the fact that the man was clearly in the advanced stages of age related dementia. The newly founded committee calls upon members of parliament to speak out against what they consider to be the most horrendous of injustices, and have sought an audience with the cabinet to explain their position.
EVTDESC22500;A bleak day today for $COUNTRY$, as $CAPITAL$'s financial district reels from the shock of a burst speculation bubble. Real estate prices have been soaring for the past year and a half, and while some analysts have warned for quite some time that the prices have been artificially high due to the effects of inflationary over consumption, the matadors of the bull market have left any such warnings unheeded. In government circles, cries for increased bank and currency regulations are being heard, calling for an end to what is referred to as 'the failures of dog-eat-dog capitalism'.
EVTDESC22510;A major crash on the $CAPITAL$ stock market has devolved into something much worse entirely, following massive bank runs triggered by plummeting saver's confidence in the banking sector. As people scramble to secure their life savings, more and more banks and credit institutions fail, triggering domino effects affecting the entire $COUNTRY_ADJ$ financial sector. The ripples from the crash soon spread to other sectors of private industry, as loans are defaulted and savings vanish seemingly into thin air. Widespread unemployment, caused by entire sectors of industry failing almost overnight, soon follow. With the intertwining of the economies of the western world, the crisis quickly spreads to other countries, and the effects of the crash now reverberate around the world, in what will be known to posterity as: The $YEAR$ Great Depression.
EVTDESC22520;As there are no laws prohibiting or regulating private banking practices in $COUNTRY$, several private institutions are issuing their own currencies. While some argue that the hard earned savings of the common man are far too important to be left to the private sector, the case is rather the opposite in one of our states, where the plethora of banking institutions available allows people the freedom of choice to save their money in banks, and thus currencies, which they actually know and trust.
EVTDESC22530;A newly formed railway company in one of our states has issued shares in the company to help finance the burgeoning firm, and are now seeking buyers and investors in the state. The CEO of the company has approached local politicians, asking them if they could, perhaps, lend a bit of a hand in the marketing of these shares to the general public, arguing that an extension of the railway networks in the state can only be beneficial and should be promoted. Some feel that this might infringe on the principles of official neutrality with regards to private ventures, while other see only opportunities.
EVTDESC22540;Selling Greenwood & Burns at 9.76, buying at 9.5! Atman & Sons 8.12, selling, selling!'\n\nLocal businessmen in one of our provinces have formed a joint venture company to establish a local stock exchange primarily aimed at the commodities trade. The venture will doubtlessly increase local productive efforts!
EVTDESC22550;A bank run has ensued in one of our states today, following news that a local bank has been issuing currency to a value far exceeding its liquid assets. The situation has been raised to the national level and parliament, where opponents of free banking use the case to argue against the system of free banking as such, calling on the government to move toward a tighter regulation of the banking sector, which is opposed by powerful interests within industrialist circles and the free trade lobby.
EVTDESC22560;Our country's economy has been booming of late, following a long period of relatively low unemployment and a well fed populace. High savings and a productive population, combined with advances in the field of economic instruments and the establishment of investment banks, means that we now are better poised than ever before to develop our national industries, and bring our country's economy to new heights.
EVTDESC22570;One of the major companies in one of our states has gone bankrupt recently, following a long period of running at a deficit. Local politicians have petitioned the government to step in in support of the company, claiming that the downturn is only temporary, and that the company can get back on its feet if allowed some time to reconstruct and consolidate. While we could support the business, vocal members of parliament have lambasted the idea, calling it an absurd abridgment of the fundamental freedoms of trade and government non-interventionism.
EVTDESC22580;$COUNTRY$ is abuzz with news of an alleged railroad trust, exposed by an anti-trust commission set up in one of our states. Local capitalists protest the allegations as absurd, claiming that no malicious coordination of prices, or price fixing has occurred. Many among the working classes are irate about the affair, feeling strongly that they are being squeezed hard by capitalist tycoons trying to make a profit out of their hardship. Breaking up the trust will set local railroad building back several years, but not doing it might anger broad strata of our population.
EVTDESC23200;The Royal Geographic Society has announced that an award will be presented to the first explorer who determines the source of the Nile.
EVTDESC23201;Our national expedition to find the source of the Nile has returned without success, but they have great hope that another expedition will succeed.
EVTDESC23202;The Second Expedition to find the Source of the Nile has disappeared without a trace, and are now presumed lost? Should we make a third attempt in this quest?
EVTDESC23203;Our intrepid explorers have mapped out the source of the Nile, and have brought glory and prestige to our great country!
EVTDESC23204;The Royal Geographic Society has announced that an award will be presented to the first expedition that reaches the North Pole.
EVTDESC23205;Our national expedition to reach the North Pole has returned without success, but they have great hope that another expedition will succeed.
EVTDESC23206;The Second Expedition to reach the North Pole has disappeared without a trace, and are now presumed lost? Should we make a third attempt in this quest?
EVTDESC23207;Our intrepid explorers have been the first to raise a flag at the North Pole and have brought glory and prestige to our great country!
EVTDESC23208;The Royal Geographic Society has announced that an award will be presented to the first expedition that reaches the South Pole.
EVTDESC23209;Our national expedition to reach the South Pole has returned without success, but they have great hope that another expedition will succeed.
EVTDESC23210;The Second Expedition to reach the South Pole has disappeared without a trace, and are now presumed lost? Should we make a third attempt in this quest?
EVTDESC23211;Our intrepid explorers have been the first to raise a flag at the South Pole and have brought glory and prestige to $COUNTRY$!
EVTDESC23212;A Comet was sighted in the sky, some believe that this portends fell times ahead. Others believe that they are in fact pixie fairies floating in the sky. There are also those who believe that this comet is most probably a giant ball of ice floating through the sky and the long tail is created due to the energy of the sun. The arguments amongst the three equally viable theories is stimulating the pursuit of knowledge in our country.
EVTDESC23213;Our expedition to the South Pole has awoken something horrible. In the ruins of a vast alien city they discovered things unidentifiable as either plants or animals. Things that ruled the Earth in the ancient past. Things that are returning and are filled with unspeakable hungers.
EVTDESC23450;The last will of the recently deceased Swedish inventor and industrialist Alfred Nobel has reserved his entire fortune for the establishment of a foundation to award prizes each year to meritorious researchers in the fields of chemistry, physics, and physiology or medicine, as well as authors of groundbreaking literature and activists whose work best promotes international peace and cooperation.
EVTDESC23451;One of our illustrious scientists has been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Physics.
EVTDESC23491;One of our illustrious scientists has been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
EVTDESC23531;One of our illustrious scientists has been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology.
EVTDESC23571;One of our illustrious authors has been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature.
EVTDESC23611;An activist in our nation prominent in the movement towards global peace and cooperation has been awarded Nobel Peace Prize.
EVTDESC2500;One of our citizens was arrested today by police from a neighboring country, charged with spying on their defensive installations along our mutual border. The only problem with the arrest is that the citizen in question was arrested, contrary to claims made by our neighbor, on our side of the border. The local Chief of Police has demanded from his colleague on the other side of the border that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ national be immediately released, and that $COUNTRY$ be issued an official apology.
EVTDESC2510;The SS $CAPITAL$, a small military steamer, mysteriously sank yesterday while on port call in a foreign harbor, following a massive explosion on the starboard midship. Military Intelligence suggests that the explosion may have been caused by an overheated boiler, but the widely circulated scandal press, taking its usual liberties with truth in favor of expediency, has already seized the opportunity and are calling the explosion an act of sabotage and aggression by a foreign power. Our citizens are in ire over the affair, and calls for foreign blood to be spilled can be heard echoing on the streets of $CAPITAL$, the ships' namesake.
EVTDESC2520;Our ambassador to one of the other great powers has telegraphed home expressing his frustration with the response, or rather, lack of it, that he has received while trying to settle a bilateral extradition treaty with the country in question. Apparently our ambassador has been snubbed repeatedly by this foreign administration, and has been delegated to speaking to civil servants instead of being allowed direct access to the country's decision makers. This diplomatic back-and-forth has been going on for two months.
EVTDESC2530;A colonial regiment in one of our colonies has had an encounter with a regiment from another colonial power, which had, according to a military report, crossed into our colonial claim on an obscure waterway a fair distance into the colony's hinterland. The report further goes on to state that this foreign regiment was, when encountered by our patrol, in the process of conducting a geological survey of the area, the object of which is as of yet unknown to us. Hawkish members of our war cabinet see this as a direct assault on $COUNTRY$'s territorial integrity, and call for the execution of a plan they have termed, quite simply, 'Operation $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fury'.
EVTDESC2540;On this subject I would like to bring up the issue of a merchant, operating out of one of my constituencies, who wrote to me last month with a most distressing story of how trade goods of his had been seized by customs officials in a foreign port. Again, I can only reiterate that further tolerance of these abridgments of the unrestricted freedom of international trade will only serve to compound the problem further with every year that passes.'\n\nAn MP known for his ardent support of free trade has held a speech in parliament today, detailing grievances against a foreign power.
EVTDESC2550;Many moons have passed since the foreigners arrived on our shores, but many more shall not pass until they are forced again to leave, or so say the leaders of our religious and military castes. There has been talk in the high councils for some time now of showing the Europeans that they cannot unopposed continue this ravaging exploitation of our native homeland.
EVTDESC2560;The $PROVINCENAME$ area has been under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control for some time, and, now, after many years, it does seem that the citizens of this province themselves consider $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule to be the only legitimate rule there is. This province is now a part of $COUNTRY$'s patrimony.
EVTDESC2570;Duce, the military high command has devised a cunning plan to increase the size of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Lebensraum through military conquest. By staging a military incident with one of our neighbors, we can make our people and the world believe that we are under attack, and the resulting military occupation and annexation of a neighboring country always look that much better when you are not perceived as the aggressor. Shall we go ahead with the plan? Shall we send our armies sweeping forth across the continent? Shall we spread terror and unheard of horrors to our enemies? Shall we...
EVTDESC29900;Mother, mother! Old man Johnson has bought a new machine! It can plough, pull, tear, move, and you can ride on it! He says it's called a 'tractor'!'\n\nThe advent of the tractor in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a revolution in local agriculture, with farm output increasing on a scale unfathomable a mere generation ago. Truly, the boons of industry are good unto $COUNTRY$.
EVTDESC29901;Mother, Mother! Have you seen the lights on Main Street? They're putting new lights in the lamp posts! They say that they're powered by 'electricity'!'\n\nElectricity, in the form of street lights, have arrived in $PROVINCENAME$. This new type of lighting illuminates our cities in ways that have hereto only been dreamt of, increasing the efficiency and productivity of local industry, as well as the local quality of life.
EVTDESC29902;Mother, Mother! Have you heard the sounds and booms echoing from the mine? They say it's a new type of explosive!'\n\nThe introduction of nitroglycerin, and with it the ability to dig deeper into the mine shafts than ever before, in $PROVINCENAME$ means that the local mining industry has increased its output several times over.
EVTDESC29903;Mother! Mother! They've opened a new store in town!'\n\nThe nineteenth century saw the development of vastly improved channels for the distribution of goods to broader groups of customers. The opening of new, specialized and industrialized retailers was essential in bringing new industrial goods, produced in factories, to consumers. The new store in $PROVINCENAME$ will increase the efficiency of the local farms, as farmers have to spend less time in travel to and from markets.
EVTDESC29904;Mother! Mother! Father says that they've got new tools in the mine!'\n\nWith the invention of machine tools, mines are slowly being fitted with new and efficient tools to aid the excavation of the slumbering riches below the surface. Mine efficiency and size has been increased in $PROVINCENAME$ on account of this.
EVTDESC3000;The reeking, putrid stench welling out of the old house smells like mould and rotting timber. There isn't a soul about, save an old drunkard who scurries out through a back-door at the first hint of light shining in through a soot-covered window. God alone knows for how long this house has been standing here, but it's dilapidated state paints a clear picture of what our nation has become in the past few decades. Poverty is becoming ever more widespread, and housing like this is standard for far too many of our nation's poor and downtrodden. Infinitely worse: These unsanitary hovels are an ample breeding ground for filth and disease.
EVTDESC30000;A delegation representing the leading commercial and manufacturing interests in our nation have proposed holding a World's Fair in our capital. Holding such an event would provide an excellent opportunity to showcase our economic capabilities and technological expertise to the rest of the world, and could significantly help our exports by popularizing our goods on the world stage. Should we provide support for this idea?
EVTDESC30001;The world has come to our capital to celebrate this World's Fair, with national pavilions from other nations and several different buildings and marvels highlighting our economic and cultural prowess to the visitors.
EVTDESC30002;A delegation representing the leading commercial and manufacturing interests in our nation have proposed holding a Regional Trade Fair in our capital. Holding such an event would provide an excellent opportunity to showcase our economic capabilities and technological expertise to our neighbors, could significantly help our exports by popularizing our goods, and promote good will with our neighbors. Should we provide support for this idea?
EVTDESC30003;Our neighbors have come to our capital to celebrate this Trade Fair, with national pavilions from other nations and several different buildings and marvels highlighting our economic and cultural prowess to the visitors.
EVTDESC30004;A delegation representing the leading commercial and manufacturing interests in our empire have proposed holding a Colonial Exposition in our capital. Holding such an event would provide an excellent opportunity to showcase the economic and cultural wealth of our colonies, could significantly help our exports by popularizing the goods produced in our empire, and further strengthen the support for our empire among our citizens at home. Should we provide support for this idea?
EVTDESC30005;Our empire and the world has come to our capital to celebrate this colonial exposition, with pavilions from our various colonies and several different buildings and marvels highlighting the importance of our economic and cultural mission to the visitors, from both home and abroad.
EVTDESC3001;While there has been ample talk in this chamber about the costs of sickness, illness and disease, I have heard only very little being said on the costs of health care, and even less mention of the costs associated with, specifically, public health care. How many private practices are being forced to close each year, due to public competition? How many apothecaries? How much private initiative is every year smothered on the altar of inefficient government bureaucracy, and how much more will it have to be before our government sets our health care free?'\n\nA counter-reform speech in parliament today has gained public interest, and a surprising amount of people are coming out in opposition to the present health-care system. How should the government react?
EVTDESC3002;He lives in a house, a very big house, in the country.'\n\nWith our urban centers growing every day from a constant stream of people flowing in from the country side and into the cities, it is no surprise to find at least a small trickle going in the other direction. With living and health conditions in the cities worsening on account of overcrowding, pollution and poor housing, some people, predominantly from the middle classes, have come to yearn again for the peace and quiet of country life, and, with living standards and wages increasing, more and more people can also afford the occasional trip out of town for some rest and recreation in the fresh open air of a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ country side.
EVTDESC3003;Aye, I'd say they fed the pigs better than they ever did us.'\n\nA local scandal coming out of one of our states has garnered a fair amount of national attention during the last few weeks. Apparently, a foreman at one of the local workhouses has embezzled public funds allotted to him, and recovered the losses by serving poorer quality food, sometimes not more than a few slices of bread each day, to the people employed by the institution. The case has become a soap-box for conservatives and liberals alike, with conservatives arguing against government intervention and liberals arguing the need for more social reforms.
EVTDESC3004;With a weak public opinion in favor of further social reform, some of our citizens in one of our states have taken the matter of caring for the downtrodden into their own hands, forming a 'Society of Friends'. The society is dedicated to carrying out various tasks of social work: food for the elderly, employment and religious education for the poor, and also runs a cooperative poor- and workhouse for these purposes.
EVTDESC3005;Thus, an additional few thousand dead this year can be attributed to the ravages of tuberculosis in our state.'\n\nA local physician's privately published report on the state of health care in his home state has caused a small public uproar in $COUNTRY$. Among general talk of the unsanitary and cramped living conditions that the disease seems to thrive on, the report is also severely critical of the government for not doing more in preventing the spread of tuberculosis by a stricter policy of quarantine, and for not providing adequate facilities for treatment. Conservatives lampoon the report as a hysterical opinion piece, and acting on it might anger them. On the other hand, we could use a sanitarium.
EVTDESC3006;And what now of the government's latest master-stroke? Apparently, if the Minister of Public Health is to be believed, free beds and food is no longer enough of a bribe to all the vagrants of the world. Teeth, gentlemen, are on the agenda!'\n\nThe ruling party has spent some effort trying to pass a Dental Care reform bill, aiming to provide our citizens with some modicum of basic dental health care. Thus far the idea has met with limited success, and there is talk among rank and file party members of abandoning the idea altogether.
EVTDESC3100;The state-run Morning Courier has published an article condemning, in harsh terms, what it claims to be the decadent behavior of the local elites in one of our states, calling them unpatriotic and claiming that certain circles among them secretly receive support from foreign powers to work against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ruling party. These news have taken hold with the lower classes of the province, who are becoming increasingly militant and projecting their anger at local power holders. Suppressing the newspaper will anger the lower classes, who will see it as a cover-up on our part, but not doing it will engender a feeling of exposure among the upper classes.
EVTDESC3101;The Daily Telegraph, which sees state-wide circulation in one of our states, has published an article exposing, in a rather picturesque manner, the details of a local politicians love-life, which apparently goes far beyond the confines of home and wife. While the article isn't slanderous per se, it is having a clear impact on the reputation and good name of the politician in question. The public has found the incident amusing, and the politician is now fast becoming the running gag of the town. The politician himself, angry at this attack upon his character, has petitioned the local court to ban the newspaper on grounds of 'breach of morality and public trust'. Shutting down the paper will rouse liberals in the state, but not doing it will increase the support for press reforms.
EVTDESC3102;Having a free press means having to deal with the strangest things. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Watchman, a queer little tabloid that sees a fair amount of circulation in one of our states, has published an opinion-piece painting the Foreign Minister out to be a member of a Secret Masonic Sect. While this isn't outside the normal scope of this low-brow nonsense paper, this particular piece of bad writing has received more attention than usual. People, for one reason or another, actually seem to believe these accusations. Denying the rumors will be seen by the literate upper classes as a giving-in to plebianism, but not denying the rumors will cause said lower-classes to actually believe in them.
EVTDESC31100;The archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann unearthed the remains of the lost city of Troy in Turkey! This discovery led to an explosion of talent in archaeology and captured the imagination of millions.
EVTDESC31102;Our position in Istanbul is no longer secure. We should move our government to a safer place.
EVTDESC31300;In January 1837, the first official census was held in Switzerland. According to the results, Switzerland had a total population of 2,190,258.
EVTDESC31301;In August 1838, France demanded the extradition of Louis Napoleon, nephew of Emperor Napoleon I, and pretender to the French throne, from Switzerland. The Swiss refused, and a French invasion was only averted by Louis Napoleon's departure for London.
EVTDESC31302;In 1852, telegraphy based on the Morse system came to Switzerland. Initially, there were 27 telegraph stations in the Alpine country.
EVTDESC31303; A referendum has been held and the people have agreed that the railroads should be nationalised.
EVTDESC31304;A referendum has been held, and the people have agreed that Jews should be considered full citizens of Switzerland.
EVTDESC31305;A referendum has been held and the people have agreed that a state-run liquor monopoly should be established.
EVTDESC31306;The Radical Liberals staged a bloody coup in Ticino that was defeated by federal troops. This incident increased tensions on both sides of the conflict, but the acquittal of the coup's leaders convinced reactionary elements that the federal government was out to get them.
EVTDESC31307;Elisabeth von Wittelsbach, the Empress of Austria, was assassinated by an Italian Anarchist, Luigi Lucheni. This horrible act occurred in the Hotel Beau-Rivage in Geneva.
EVTDESC31308;The Zimmerwald conference of the Socialist International, which convened on September 4 1915, , was the first such meeting to follow the outbreak of the Great War in August of 1914. Whereas the previous meeting of the International, held in Basel in November 1912, had looked forward to the possibility of war as an opportunity to overturn the capitalist order, the horrendous casualties produced by the fighting led delegates at the Zimmerwald conference to denounce the war as the result of imperialism and called upon workers to resist its prosecution. Many prominent leaders of the Socialist movement gathered for this meeting, including Lazzari and Modigliani from Italy, Lenin and Bobrow from Russia, the Germans Ledebour and Hoffmann, French socialists Bourderon and Merrheim and many more.
EVTDESC31309;A Socialist convention was held in Kienthal. Many leading Socialists gathered to argue over different ways of bringing about the Socialist paradise.
EVTDESC31310;16 countries signed the Geneva Convention to improve the lot of soldiers wounded during combat. As a symbol they choose a reversal of the Swiss flag: A red cross on white ground.
EVTDESC31311;Article 1. Ambulances and military hospitals shall be recognized as neutral, and as such, protected and respected by the belligerents as long as they accommodate wounded and sick.'\n\nSwitzerland has called an international convention at Geneva to discuss, formalize and agree upon a set of international rules and guidelines for the conduct of war. All the civilized nations of the world have been invited to sign what will become known as 'The Geneva Convention'
EVTDESC31501;Smoking tobacco became an increasingly widespread fashion. In $YEAR$, the authorities in $CAPITAL$ forbade smoking in public.
EVTDESC31502;At the age of 67, Emperor Franz I of $COUNTRY$ died, whereupon his mentally and physically impaired son Ferdinand I ascended the throne. Because of Ferdinand's inabilities, a so-called Geheime Regierungskonferenz (Secret Government Conference), which includes Klemens Wenzel, Ferst Metternich, assumed day-to-day control of the government for him.
EVTDESC31503;To strengthen the stature and independence of Hungary within the double monarchy, Hungarian became the sole language spoken in the Hungarian parliament.
EVTDESC3200;We, the People's Committee For a Free $COUNTRYNAME$, therefore present the following simple demand to the government in $CAPITAL$: An end to the one-party state.'\n\nSimple demands, bah. Who do these ruffians think that they are? Leaflets carrying anti-government slogans have been appearing in bars and coffeehouses all across one of our states, and we suspect that they are produced by an underground printing press in the region. The local police wants to shut down the operation, and this would all be a routine operation if it weren't for the fact that these leaflets have picked up an extensive circle of readers in the state. Shutting down the press will doubtlessly cause a fair amount of anger.
EVTDESC3201;The mayoral election in one of our provinces has erupted into a violent affair today, as a local farmer refused to fill in the vote for the government candidate, despite being ordered to do so. The large built farmer is said to have crushed the nose of three local officials before finally being hauled away by police from the city hall where the election was taking place. We are told that he was screaming about his right to vote has his conscience dictated, or some other tomfoolery like that. We probably need to punish him somehow to set an example, but our decision will have consequences either way.
EVTDESC3202;From time to time we... modify... the maps of the political constituencies to better... conform with what we believe people truly want out of the political system. If we notice that the wrong party is gaining traction where we do not feel that they should, we simply redefine the voter uptake area for the constituency to better match... a more reasonable policy. We've noticed that there has been a strong voiced support for liberal policies in one of our provinces recently, and we're not sure that the area should be allowed to actually vote along those lines. We could bring in some neighboring districts to form a strong conservative base in the entire state, but we would increase local militancy by doing so.
EVTDESC3203;As John Q. Public walks up to the ballot box, he knows instinctively that he is being watched. By the official presiding the vote, by the man watching him put his ballot in the box, by a government agent in a bar, behind a cut-hole newspaper. Somehow, somewhere, someone is watching him, and feeding the government information about his political opinions and voting preferences. John's secret fear is that that someone, on some dark night, will come knocking on his door, to have a little chat about loyalties and disloyalties. John Q. Public would very much prefer it if he could give his vote in secret.
EVTDESC3204;A major instance of voting fraud has occurred in an election for a local assembly in one of our states. We have every reason to believe that the vote was actually a major victory for local conservatives, but the liberal party has nevertheless claimed victory. Stepping in from a national level to correct these frauds is what is expected of us, and securing the conservative victory would reduce overall militancy in the area, but then again... maybe the liberals would be better to have in power?
EVTDESC32500;One of the most influential writers in modern Russian literature, who brought Russia to par with the rest of Europe, Pushkin was known for works like 'Eugen Onegin', 'Boris Godunow', and 'The Captain's Daughter'. He died in February 1837, after a duel with a French immigrant.
EVTDESC32501;In Paris, the Committee for Polish Independence was founded, to support the movement for Polish independence from Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Prussia.
EVTDESC32502;Founded in $YEAR$, the Petrashevski Circle discussed reforms in Czarist Russia. Among the Circle's members were people like Fyodor M. Dostoyevski. In May 1849, 123 members of the circle were arrested, and Petrashevsky himself was sent to Siberia.
EVTDESC32503;The art collection in the Hermitage, built after plans of Leo von Klenze, opened in St. Petersburg. It made available to the public some of the finest and most precious pieces of art to be found in all of Russia.
EVTDESC32504;On 8 February 1874, after years of work and revisions, Mussorgsky's Opera 'Boris Godunov' was published and had its inaugural performance. Seeking to blend Russian folk music with the ideas of Richard Wagner, the Opera aimed to present itself as a truly national form of music.
EVTDESC32505;In 1880, Fyodor Dostoevsky completed his magnum opus, 'The Brothers Karamazov'. One of the most arresting works in the entire history of literature, 'The Brothers Karamazov' was a comedy that developed the major themes of Dostoevsky's post-Socialist career as a writer. A comedy, perhaps, but arguably the most serious comedy ever written. In his memoir, 'The Diary of a Writer', Dostoevsky dismissed leftist criticisms of his work by remarking that no leftist had ever provided as damaging a critique of Christianity as his Chapters 'Rebellion' and 'The Grand Inquisitor' in The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky's works were hugely influential not only in Russia but also throughout the West,  and not only in literary circles, but in philosophical and religious ones as well.
EVTDESC32506;In 1837, a 26 km-long rail line was built connecting St. Petersburg with a royal residence in Czarskoe Selo. This was the first railroad in the Russian empire.
EVTDESC32507;The first official Russo-Japanese agreement, called the 'Treaty on Friendship, Trade, and Borders',  was signed by Russian Vice-Admiral Putyatin on February 7th 1855 in Shimoda. The northern Kuril Islands became part of Russia, while Sakhalin remained under the 'joint' jurisdiction of the two countries. Japan agreed as well to open three of its ports to Russian traders.
EVTDESC32508;The production style of Checkov's The Sea Gull has shown that the Moscow Art Theatre is almost single-handedly taking the Russian Theatre into the twentieth century.
EVTDESC32509;The feelers put out by Eduard Andreevich Stoeckl, charge d'affaires at our embassy in Washington, have had results, as The United States has today offered to enter into negotiations over a proposed sale of our territories in North America. The Americans are offering us a price of 2.3 cents per acre for the Alaskan territories, and that price seems relatively fair. The colonies could become hard to defend in the event of war with the United Kingdom, so getting rid of them for a price now might not be such a bad idea. What say you, $MONARCHTITLE$?
EVTDESC32510;$MONARCHTITLE$, Russia has agreed to sell Alaska to us!
EVTDESC32511;$MONARCHTITLE$, negotiations with Russia over a sale of the Alaska territory have stranded, and Russia has declined to sell us the territory.
EVTDESC3300;Is it, I ask of this government, right, that a man with a life of hard and honest work behind him, should be left without aid or assistance merely on account of the whims of fate?'\n\nA farmer in one of our states has had a near-fatal threshing accident which has left him permanently disabled and disfigured. The case has been brought to the national scene in parliamentary debates over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pensions system, where reform-minded MPs have used the case as a bat with which to beat the government for not doing more to help the old and disabled.
EVTDESC33000;The theatrical troupe of the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen has performed their repertory in Berlin to great acclaim. They will soon begin a series of tours to nations throughout Europe.
EVTDESC33001;In 1874, Carl Hagenbeck,  the son of an animal trader, held his first show about exotic peoples in Hamburg. In 1887 he expanded on the concept, founding a circus which relied on training animals without force. Eventually in 1907, Hagenback unveiled his open-air zoo in Hamburg, an exemplary zoo of its kind.
EVTDESC33002;School director Konrad Duden published his first Complete Orthographical Dictionary of the German Language in 1880. It became the foundation for German orthography in subsequent years, and is still the definitive dictionary for the German language.
EVTDESC33004;Our governor in Schleswig has proposed that the anti-German element in the region be reduced through the enforcement of German-language education and the expulsion of Danish citizens still resident in the province. Should we undertake this proposal?
EVTDESC33005;In 1903, the Baghdad Railroad, a project prominently financed by Germans, was announced with plans to connect Constantinople and Baghdad. This marked one of the high points in the good relations between Constantinople and Berlin.
EVTDESC3301;As our average life expectancies have increased over the years, more and more families have had to take care of their elderly who are no longer able to provide for themselves. The social makeup of our country is changing, and without much in way of a national plan for the elderly and the disabled, a lot are falling between the cracks in the system. Conservatives have by and large taken the stance that the family is the first and last social support structure for the elderly, and that an increasing role for government in the area threatens to unravel important societal bonds. Liberals, on the other hand, see our pensions as tragically lacking, pointing to the many who, seemingly, go without aid.
EVTDESC3302;I have, in my overview of government policy, been careful not to attribute to malice that which can reasonably be attributed to sheer stupidity. The task has been daunting at times.'\n\nOur pensions system has come under attack by opposition within the ruling party. Aside from various administrative complaints against the system, the focal point of the critique seems to be that the pensions are, quite simply, too low. Some sort of response would be in order.
EVTDESC3303;Me 'ole lyfe I've been workin' hard, an' what do I get nuw? Gruel.'\n\nThe pensions system has been on everyone's lips and minds the past week, with the publication of a parliamentary report on the pensions system. The report is fairly nuanced in its overall conclusions about the system, but the issue that has stuck with people is an attached case-study interview with an elderly gentleman left out of the pensions system on what seems like mere technicalities, who complains about having worked hard all his life, but now being fed nothing but gruel.
EVTDESC3304;"And while our hard pressed economy is bleeding massive sums into the pensions system, alarming concerns are at the same time being raised about the systematic exploitation of the system, with children at the age of thirteen in some cases being listed as recipients!\n\nMassive debates in parliament today as the Committee on Pensions and Living Standards today disbanded without submitting its final report. Apparently, internal conflict in the bi-partisan committee over hearing procedures has become a terminal stumbling block. The resulting confusion in parliament could be exploited to quickly rescind some of the more costly welfare reforms."""
EVTDESC3305;Since I was a boy, for all my life, I've marched. Up and down, and back and forth, I've marched with the firm conviction that I would die young, in service of the country that I hold dearer than any other under the sun. Yet, now, when my life draws to more peaceful ends, I cannot help but notice that I am old.'\n\nWhile life expectancies in $COUNTRY$ are decidedly on the increase, the unfortunate interaction between a relatively low wage, and equally low pensions, means that very few people can afford to make preparations for an old age where they are no longer capable of working. The educated middle classes would prefer to see a raise in the minimum wage, while the aristocracy argues in favor of raising pensions.
EVTDESC3306;With the war raging, and our nation growing more weary of it by the day, some within our cabinet have hinted that now might be the best time to provide our population with some idea of the post-war future. Our interior minister has presented us with a suggestion that he claims is well anchored in parliament. By promising a major pension reform after the war, we could muster a fair amount of support for the war in fairly broad stratas of our population.
EVTDESC3307;During the war we promised our people a pension reform. Now, with the war over, people are expecting their government to hold true to its word.
EVTDESC33300;The Theater of the grand duchy burnt to the ground in Karlsruhe. 63 people died in the disaster.
EVTDESC33400;In Donaustauf near Regensburg the Walhalla, a classicist monument fashioned after Greek temples and named after the legendary afterworld of Norse mythology, was opened in 1842. In this hall of fame busts of famous Germans are displayed for the public.
EVTDESC33401;The affair with the dancer Lola Montez, who he had made a countess, proved to be the end of King Ludwig I's reign. Conservative-Catholic circles objected so strongly to their relationship that he had to abdicate. Lola Montez died an impoverished woman in New York.
EVTDESC33402;Founded in 1836, The New Pinacotheque opened its door to the public in 1853. The focus of the works in its collection are the Old Masters.
EVTDESC33403;The composer Richard Wagner has completed construction of the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth. It is envisioned that a festival devoted to performing great German works of the theatre will be held here each year.
EVTDESC33800;A fire lasting three days destroyed almost one third of Hamburg. The catastrophe led to reforms in fire fighting and city development plans.
EVTDESC33801;Off the shore of Newfoundland', the process of smoking, a method of disinfection using smoking tar, led to the sinking of the HAPAG ship Austria. 495 people, mostly emigrants from Europe, died in the incident.
EVTDESC33802;Leading merchants of Hamburg founded the 'Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt Actiengesellschaft', providing for transport across the Atlantic. Their services were welcomed by the constantly growing number of emigrants to the Americas.
EVTDESC33900;Duke Wilhelm of Brunswick-Luneburg died without any suitable heir. Ernst August II, as his nearest male cousin, succeeded him as Duke of Brunswick. Thus, the Duchy became part of our Kingdom
EVTDESC3400;I've been around to all workplaces in the city, but I just can't seem to get a break, sir. I wonder what to do, I cannot go home and let the grass grow round my feet all day. My family trust me to support them, but what should a poor sod do when there are no jobs available?'\n\nWith jobs scarce, and creditors inversely plentiful, many from the poorer classes are having trouble making ends meet.
EVTDESC3401;We want jobs! We need jobs!'\n\nPrevailing economic theory holds that our government needs to maintain an active economic policy in order to create more jobs in our industries, however, with unemployment figures climbing over the five percent line, some of the ideologues within the party have now suggested an increase in the unemployment subsidies in order to mollify the masses while we wait for our economy to recover.
EVTDESC3402;And with this years budget, our payments to the unemployment programs will, again, exceed budget by several percentages. And this is what this is really all about, gentlemen, percentages. Those critical percentages that stand between us and bankruptcy.'\n\nOur unemployment programs are starting to run at a heavier loss than expected, and some taxpayers are becoming extremely concerned with these runaway strains on the budget. A committee acting out of one of our states has formed a coalition for the revocation of unemployment benefits, and are making national headlines with their efforts.
EVTDESC3403;The workers have occupied the factory! The doors are barricaded! No one can get in!'\n\nWorkers in one of our states have occupied a factory, and are staging a sit-down strike. Their demands include a higher minimum wage, and better unemployment subsidies. We can offer tacit support to one of the causes, or choose to ignore the issue completely.
EVTDESC3404;An unorganized wildcat strike has broken out in one of our states. The workers have barricaded a local workshop and refuse to let anyone in until, as they put it, 'their demands are met'. The problem is that they seem to have fairly limited conceptions of what it is they actually want, except 'more'. A local union boss has offered to mediate the issue, but the best option might be to just ignore them.
EVTDESC34100;In 1838, 42 choral societies from the Rhineland, Baden, Hessen, and Franconia met in Frankfurt to celebrate a three-day festival of Mozart's music. The event turned into a demonstration for the political unification of Germany, however.
EVTDESC34500;When Oldenburg was elevated from a Duchy to a Grand Duchy on June 9th 1815, His Highness Peter II became the first monarch to use officially the title of Grand Duke on his formal accession.
EVTDESC34600;Adolph Diesterweg, a German educator, laid down principles for the teaching of children that aimed at making them conscious, thinking, responsible citizens. His ideas get him suspended in 1847.
EVTDESC34601;In August 1841, Hoffmann von Fallersleben wrote his poem Deutschlandlied on Helgoland. Combined with the melody of the Austrian Joseph Haydn's Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser, it would one day become the German national anthem.
EVTDESC34602;On June 7th 1840, King Friedrich Wilhelm III died, almost 70 years old. His son, a romantic, succeeded him on the throne.
EVTDESC34603;Berlin saw the opening of Germany's first zoological garden in August $YEAR$. Other such gardens already existed in London and Antwerp.
EVTDESC34604;A Prussian law of October 1845 ordered Jews to take fixed family names. They were now also obliged to serve in the military.

EVTDESC34607;The Krupp company in Essen introduced a health insurance fund for their 970 workers. Membership was mandatory.
EVTDESC34608;Following Britain's lead, in 1839 Prussia, under the influence of some religious and social figures, passed a law strictly regulating the amount of child labour that was possible during the year.
EVTDESC34700;In 1837, Albert Lortzing's best known opera, Zar und Zimmermann (Czar and Carpenter) premiered in Leipzig. Lortzing is regarded as the father of the German comedic opera, the counterpart of the romantic opera.
EVTDESC34701;Professor Gottfried Semper, court architect in Saxony, finished one of his masterpieces, the Dresden Opera House, which was named after him. His style was influenced by both Classicism and Renaissance styles, and not least because of his work, Dresden earned the nickname of Florence on the Elbe.
EVTDESC3500;They call him Red John. They say he came on a boat loaded with bricks and mortar, a soul loaded with whiskey and gunpowder. In the past few months, this cosmopolitan agitator has been stirring up trouble in one of our provinces, soapboxing for higher wages, holding meetings in factories, and talking about the need for workers to unionize. This man is clearly trouble, and local police have just received news that he's holding a meeting in a local tavern tonight...
EVTDESC3501;The workers in the state-run Worker's Committee in one of our provinces have proposed that all local workers be given an extra day off each year, on account of the hardships they endure. While this would, in the grand scheme of things, not cost us very much, it would still be seen as us pandering overly much to the sensibilities of the working classes, and it might give the riff-raff bad ideas for the future.
EVTDESC3502;So we need him removed. Not just removed, but removed good. Ya'see? We don't want him no more. He's bad news, I'll tell'ya.'\n\nThe Mill Workers trade union in one of our provinces are protesting against factory manager accused of abusing his workers, even going so far as to beat them with canes whenever they happen to trigger his highly personal definition of laziness. We could remove the manager, but the mill owner insist that he does a very good job.
EVTDESC3503;A group of scabs being shipped in to man the factories in one of our states, in the absence of a local group of striking workers, have been surrounded in their lodgings by a group of agitated workers from the 23rd Local Labourer's Union. Tensions on the site rise high, and factory officials have requested that the army units be called in to quell the strikers. Quelling the strike by force will leave a long-term stain on our international prestige, and anger the locals, but not doing it will cause the socialists to gain ground in the state on account of the perceived victory.
EVTDESC35300;Giacomo Puccini, who was successful in transforming the play Madame Butterfly, by the American playwright, David Belasco, into an opera in 1904, premiered another work based on Belasco's 'The Girl of the Golden West' as La Fanciulla del West.
EVTDESC35301;Enrico Caruso's performance of Rigoletto at Covent Garden in London vaulted him to international fame.
EVTDESC35400;Verdi's most influential work, 'Nabucco', which premiered in the Scala opera house in Milan, captivated the hearts of many Italians. Its prisoner choir would go on to become Italy's unofficial anthem.
EVTDESC35700;Pope Leo XIII's encyclical on the 'Rights and Duties of Capital and Labour' began with the words 'Rerum Novarum'. In the encyclical's analysis, the spirit of socialist revolutionary change had begun to pervade ever more areas. The causes of the conflict, it claimed, were clear: The vast expansion of industrial pursuits, the changed relations between masters and workmen, the accumulation of enormous fortunes by a few individuals and the utter poverty of the masses, and the prevailing moral degeneracy.  The encyclical argued that Socialism threatened the religious and moral foundation of the state and sought to break the common interests of the Church and State, the employer and the employed, and replace them with an evil, atheist doctrine. To counter this threat, associations must be formed that satisfy the needs of progress and yet protect the weak. The encyclical quoted the Apostle Paul saying that 'Charity is patient, is kind ... seeketh not her own ... suffereth all things ... endureth all things'.
EVTDESC3600;The tortured scream made the whole factory stop. The man pulled and pulled so that the machine would let go of his badly wounded arm. When the machine reluctantly spat out his arm, he fell unconscious to the ground. His colleagues flocked around him and the foreman had to tell them twice to get out of the way and get back to work. The wounded man was carried out while the silent crowd resumed its work.
EVTDESC3601;Despite all his cautiousness, Mr. Brown had a tough workweek.\nMonday: nearly lost his eyesight on his left eye due to an careless coworker and a ladder.\nTuesday: ruined his best shirt in an desperate attempt to save his arm from a gluttonous machine.\nWednesday: escaped by near fright when a brick came tumbling down from above, dropped by a construction worker.\nThursday: slipped on an oil slick and nearly broke his neck.\nFriday: choked on a piece of sandwich but was saved by a thump on his back.\nSome of his accidents could have been avoided if the safety regulations in the factory were followed.
EVTDESC3602;An almost new idea has been adopted by the construction workers of $COUNTRY$: safety helmets. The first ones to be used were old combat helmets which war veterans had given to their sons, and after the helmets have saved one worker's life, others began wearing similar headgear to work. Sometimes old kettles or cauldrons were even used, after a bit of modification. This has improved the safety at the building sites and very few workers are hurt by accidentally dropped tools or other things.
EVTDESC3603;It costs us too much and the workers don't always follow the regulations. They neglect the use of proper safety equipment and we have more accidents than we ever had before.'\n'He is lying. The safety regulations work very well, the workers still have accidents, but their injuries are not as serious as before.'\n\nEmployers and workers argue about the safety regulations. The employers feel that the safety regulations are useless, cost too much, and that the workers disregard the rules. The workers, however, feel that accidents and injuries happens more seldom and they follow the regulations scrupulously.
EVTDESC3604;Using labor spies in our factories may prevent strikes and disperse some of the trade unions' power, but chances are that if our workers realise that we are spying on them, they will turn against us and start rioting. Rumours from other provinces about labor spies talk about the sometimes illegal, but effective, methods that have been used to discourage further labor disruptions by agitators.
EVTDESC3605;The police in one of our provinces have initiated a strike today, citing concerns about work safety regulations. The demands from the local union are better standardized procedures for carrying out arrests, bookings and criminal investigations, and also requests for better health care plans. The government could try to meet these demands, but some voices within our cabinet argue that this strike is unlawful, and a threat to public safety.
EVTDESC3606;Warnings about yellow phosphorus causing phossy jaw have begun spreading in the match industry. Phossy jaw is a painful disease with painful toothaches and swelling of the gums as first symptoms. The jaw bones will over time begin to abscess and surgical removal of the afflicted bones is then the only medical option available to save the patient. Our medical expertise have recommend a switch to the use of the safer, but more expensive, red phosphorus, as it would stop the disease.
EVTDESC3607;Fewer sick days, fewer accidents and many happy workers have made our factories to some of the safest and healthiest in the world. It seems that our healthcare and safety reforms have finally paid off. Our workers are happy, and the production rates are higher than ever.
EVTDESC36200;Following upon the work of Stenderforsamlingerne and during the war against Slevig-Holsten and Prussia, the Danish King Frederik VII signed the Constitution,which allowed, among other things, parliamentary elections, a common draft, and the end of single rulings by the King. The King still enjoyed the right to select his cabinet from the majority party and approve of legislation, but the first true Danish democracy had been born.
EVTDESC36201;In 1871, Louis Pio formed the Danish chapter of the Socialist Internationale and began agitating for social reforms and the unification of workers.
EVTDESC36202;In 1872, following a strike lasting several months, Louis Pio called for a large open-air meeting on the Copenhagen Common. The Police allowed this, but nevertheless confronted the striking workers with a large force consisting of mounted police and army patrols. A fight broke out and the police arrested Louis Pio and a number of other Socialist leaders. Pio was sentenced to five years in prison.
EVTDESC36203;In 1875,  the Socialist Leader Louis Pio was pardoned from his sentence on the Kinges birthday and returned to lead the by-now growing Social Democratic movement. However, his leadership caused a number of conflicts and by the end of 1875 he suddenly emigrated to America. It later turned out that the police had bribed him to leave.
EVTDESC36204;In 1848, slaves in the Danish Virgin Islands rebelled. The Governor, Peter von Scholten, decided to free them, rather than use force to crush the rebellion. Von Scholten cited an 1847 law that stated that all babies born to slaves were to be free. Von Scholten's action met with considerable resistance from planters. He was recalled to Denmark and put on trial, but he was later exonerated by the Supreme Court.
EVTDESC36205;From 1886 to 1892, more than 25 modern fortifications were built on Sjaelland to ensure that any possible threat from Germany would be thwarted.
EVTDESC36206;After the loss of SenderJylland, Ernst Matthias von Keller began an oppressive campaign to Germanize the former Danish provinces. Danish citizens were expelled and an earlier law from 1888 requiring that German be the only language of instruction in public schools was strictly enforced.
EVTDESC36207;In 1899, an alliance of different trade unions formed a common assembly and declared a general strike.
EVTDESC36208;P.A. Alberti had resigned one month earlier as Secretary of Justice, when he turned himself in to answer charges that had swindled his own bank for more than 15 million Kroner, a sum equal to one-fifth of Denmark's annual budget. Alberti resigned after having used the national exchequer to help finance a number of loans, and his arrest led to the fall of the government. A 刪igsretsage or State Trial was initiated against Alberti and two accomplices who had helped him hide his crimes.
EVTDESC36209;Following a request from the US to purchase the islands, an advisory election was held and in 1917 Denmark sold the islands for cash.
EVTDESC36210;Fyrretyve fortellinger af fedrelandets historie, was published in 1882, written by A.D Jergensen. It proved to be of great help to Danish minorities south of the border in maintaining their Danish identity
EVTDESC36211;Det danske Hedesleskab (Danish Moor Company) was founded after the war in 1864, as a result of which one-third of the country was lost. The company's goal was to develop the moor in Jutland, and to 'regain internally what had been lost externally.'
EVTDESC36212;The Castle of Christiansborg, rebuilt after a fire in 1794, caught fire once again in 1884. The main part burned to the ground, and was not rebuilt before 1907 because of the political climate.
EVTDESC36213;The Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek was founded by Carl Jacobsen, Owner of the brewery Ny Carlsberg in 1892. In the beginning it was mainly used for Carl Jacobsen's extensive collection of modern sculptures, but later classical sculptures were included as well.
EVTDESC36214;Jacob Estrup, the Danish prime minister for many years, was not a widely popular man. A young socialist tried to shoot him in 1885, but the bullet hit a button on his coat.
EVTDESC36215;A corporation was founded in 1891 by 11 breweries in Copenhagen. In 1894 it merged with Tuborg and began a close cooperation with Carlsberg in 1903, forming a very strong and large brewing industry in Denmark. United Breweries and Carlsberg merged in 1969.
EVTDESC36216;Jacob Christian Ellehamer was the first to construct an aeroplane in Denmark. He made the first flight on the 12th of September 1906. He also made various other discoveries including an air-cooled engine, a hovercraft, and a helicopter that flew on the 1st of September 1912.
EVTDESC36217;Danish writer and philosopher Kierkegaard published his work Either - Or in 1843. Kierkegaard is generally regarded as the first existentialist philosopher.

EVTDESC36219;The first of a number of schools for the lower classes, especially in farming communities. During the following decades a large number of schools would open and drastically increase the education in the country. the school accepted both girls and boys after they have begun working
EVTDESC36220;In 1871 George Brandes held the first of a series of cultural lectures. He and his brother Edvard were to become central figures in the Danish political and cultural debate ,culminating with the newspaper Politikken and the creation of a platform for Liberal political thinking.

EVTDESC36222;Historically, Denmark accepted the US offer, but it might have happened that Denmark had refused, either because the price was too low or because more jingoistic feelings were dominant at that time.
EVTDESC36230;Jan Mayen is offering to buy all our polar bears at a good price. They promise they will treat them with the care and dignity afforded to such majestic creatures.

EVTDESC36401;Farmer's son and teacher Ivar Aasen (1813-1896) saw need for a reformation of the Norwegian written language, which up to this point had been Danish. By means of several journeys across the country made through small villages and farming communities, he created the grammar and a dictionary for a 'new' Norwegian language. Although his codification of the spoken language did little to educate the people he sought to help, many of his poems and texts became songs and thus spread across the countryside. Just before his death his new language received official recognition by the Norwegian parliament.
EVTDESC36402;In the last part of the 1800s Norway was shook by the works of critical authors Henrik Ibsen, Bjernstjerne Bjernson, Alexander Kielland and Jonas Lie.

The success led to the building of a new steel manufactory in Sandviken.
EVTDESC36605;In the mid 1860's the agriculture sector was suffering after a series of meager harvests. Difficulties continued in 1867 when crops failed once again. This became 'The Wet Year' of rotting grain, which caused famine in many parts of the country.

EVTDESC36611;August Strindberg (1849-1912) was one of the most talented personalities of world literature. Playwright, novelist, and short-story writer, his work exhibited a fury and genius that combined naturalism, psychology and mysticism. 'The Red Room' brought him to fame in 1879. It satirized the institutions and conditions of Sweden in the late 1870s. A multifaceted man, Strindberg possessed a fanatic hatred of the emancipated woman, was interested in science and the occult and also tried his hand at painting, photography and alchemy!
EVTDESC36612;In 1900 the Swedish parliament decided to build an extensive fortification system in Boden near the Finnish border.

EVTDESC36616;The archaic Swedish parliament system with its Four Estates, nobility, clergy, burghers and peasantry was decided to be replaced with a parliament consisting of two chambers with equal rights, following a proposal by Louis De Geer.

It evolved to be a broad gathering of different Flemish organisations: sport clubs, music groups, theaters, intellectual organisations and so on. At first, the Movement was apolitical, but over the years, its followers became more and more militant in their beliefs and convictions. The Flemish Movement would later lead, for example, the formation of parties that lobbied for more Flemish rights in political life.
EVTDESC36702;The years between 1845 and 1850 were some of the worst for the Belgian, and most notably Flemish, population. The problems started in 1845 with the Potato Plague.

EVTDESC36926;Samuel Phelps's production of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' restored the magic to Shakespeare.

Working every day, every week, nothing more than work, work, work. Only toil, no time for pleasure.'\n\nThe punch clock is a radical new invention that has increase productivity in our factories. However, some labour agitators argue that the time clock is alienating workers from the means of production, or something to that effect.

EVTDESC3702;With standards of living gradually increasing in $COUNTRY$, more and more from the poorer classes feel that they should be entitled to a bigger share of the country's wealth and newfound prosperity. Some within the radical labour movements have suggested enacting legislation allowing workers a few hours of rest and recreation each day, even going so far as to claiming that this might in fact increase our net production output. Others are less convinced by these arguments, and claim instead that they violate the fundamental economic principles and operations of the free market.

Locals, of course, view the incident as a case of police harassment, and have started speaking up against the ban on public meetings. The incident has, for all its absurdity, shown the sweeping extent to which the government can control everyday life in $COUNTRY$
EVTDESC3751;Everywhere we go we can hear the sounds and murmurings of political discussions. It is becoming abundantly clear that the people in $COUNTRY$ are slowly waking up to more democratic traditions, and, as a result, the ban on public meetings is being less and less enforced for every day that passes.

We must either strive upwards, to claim our rightful place in the sun among the nations of the world, or descend downwards, into corruption, despotism and backwardness.'\n\nA gentlemen's club has opened in one of our provinces. Dedicated to furthering the interests of it's members, charitable causes and the nation in general, the gentleman's club is set to become a pillar of local society for years to come.
EVTDESC3753;The meeting is an orderly affair. Several people, some carrying placards, have assembled on Pine Street. Watching the people gathered, one need not be very astute an observer to see that the protestors of Pine Street are decidedly upset about something, although it is somewhat unclear what that something is. Whatever their cause, they are merely exercising their right to assemble, when, suddenly, a grimmer mood sweeps the crowd. Soon, the shouts are angrier in their crying-out, and the screams ring with tones of hatred. As local officials step in to calm tensions, the kettle reaches the boiling point, and the crowd explodes into a mob.
EVTDESC3754;A group of known radicals have been assembling at a central townhouse on Cato Street regularly for several months. The group's outspoken radical republican agenda, and its attempts to recruit new members, have led local officials to raise concerned eyebrows, and to keeping watchful eyes on the group. In a dawn raid by police early this morning, suspicions were confirmed as the group was caught red-handed planning an assault on a known member of the Cabinet, in preparation for a future coup d'etat. Although we never risked the plan seeing fruition, the incident has sparked a debate in the Upper House on the need to curtail and regulate the right to assemble.
EVTDESC3755;Enraged over their social situation, the lack of work, and the government's policies, an angry mob of unemployed workers, spurred on by agitation from local troublemakers, has attacked the workhouse in one of our provinces. Several workhouse buildings have been looted, and bread and supplies to a total value of several thousands have been stolen. Local officials have been swift in putting down the attack, and in arresting the ringleaders, but the incident will have lasting effects for years. What directives do we give the cabinet on the issue? What is the government's position?
EVTDESC3756;People have taken to the streets in one of our states, exasperated over the lack of political representation, and held a rally, calling on the government to institute political reform. While the rally has largely been a peaceful affair, several incendiary speeches were held during it, and tensions between conservatives and liberals are running high. Local aristocrats are calling on the government to condemn the speeches made at the rally, and muster support for holding back political reforms and protect the established order. Supporting the aristocratic call means angering local progressives, but not doing it means angering both conservatives and aristocrats.
EVTDESC37700;To consolidate the budget, the government in Madrid ordered that Church properties be sold. The Catholic Church's tax privileges were also revoked, while in turn the state agreed to assume the costs of church upkeep.
EVTDESC37701;Native Venezuelan General Narciso Lepez was executed by the Spanish colonial authorities in Cuba. He had landed with a small group of men, trying to incite a revolt that would turn Cuba over the U.S.A., but failed due to lack of support from the population.
EVTDESC37702;To counter the ravages of Cuban insurgents, the Governor-General instituted a policy of forced removal of all citizens in the countryside to camps in the cities. This denied sources of supply and places of refuge to the insurgent forces.
EVTDESC37703;It has come to our attention that many haciendados in Cuba would welcome Cuba's annexation to us. Perhaps Spain will sell the island?
EVTDESC37704;Parties in North America have posed the question of our selling Cuba.
EVTDESC37705;Should the King empower a commission to discuss much needed reforms in the colony of Cuba?
EVTDESC37706;Pablo Picasso abandoned the conventional ideas of painting and began using a far more conceptual style, influenced by sculpture and African art.
EVTDESC37707;In 1855, needing cash for the state, the Minister of Public Wealth, Pascual Madoz, ordered the desamortisation of all communal and public lands, and this led to a greater degree of centralization of state power and fostered unhappiness among farmers who now had no public lands to use.
EVTDESC37708;After the dissolution of the Napoleonic Guards, security in Spanish cities was the responsibility of the National Militia, formed from local militias. In $YEAR$ the Marquis of Ahumada decided to create a national corps directed by the Ministry of War. This corps would be called Civil Guard and become a substitute for the unruly National Militia.
EVTDESC3800;A place to live and escape the weather, some clothing for warmth and comfort, some food, bread and cheese one day, perhaps meat a good day. We don't want much, we don't need much, just some necessities to be able to live and work.'\n\nA pamphlet has been published in $COUNTRY$, detailing the plight of our nation's poor. The pamphlet has gained a fair amount of national attention, and some members of parliament have started arguing in favor of legislation enforcing higher minimum wages.
EVTDESC3801;As it, so rightly, has been stated: 'What a tangled web we weave'. Nowhere was this more true than in the bureaucratic mess that is our civil code since the wage reforms were implemented'\n\nMembers of parliament known for their cozy relations with $COUNTRY$'s capitalist classes have begun criticizing the minimum wage reform for its allegedly negative effects on the clarity, lucidity and simplicity of our nation's code of laws. They claim that the system is needlessly bureaucratic, and could be reformed. The reforms they suggest would, however, mean an effective abolishment of the system.
EVTDESC3802;And while I do not claim to represent all the workers of $COUNTRY$, I do make the claim that I represent at least some of them, and those that I do represent tell me this: We need better wages. Prices have increased, in some cases two-fold, over the past few years, and this must be reflected in the pockets not only of the capitalists.'\n\nA famous labour agitator has had a meeting with some fairly important members of our cabinet, and it seems he was able to make some impression on them. The general feeling of the cabinet is that we should consider our minimum wage legislation, but there is also a faction arguing that it might, in fact, be better to go in the opposite direction
EVTDESC3803;Minimum wages? Why should we need that? We have always paid our workers exactly what they have earned, and they have always been able to afford housing, clothing and food. Well, not the best housing, clothing and food, but they got by, didn't they?'\n\nOur minimum wage policies have upset some of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ employers who are now exhorting pressure, lobbying for a minimum wage repeal, on several influential members of both the parliament and our own cabinet.
EVTDESC38500;The first Omani vessel to sail to the New World, the Sultana arrived in New York in 1840, bringing the personal representative of Sultan Sayyid Said ibn Sultan to trade with America and to meet with the American government.
EVTDESC38501;Under Sultan Said Zanzibar had become the richest province in the Sultanate. Upon his death in 1856 the Sultanate was divided between Majid in Zanzibar and Thuwaini in Muscat.
EVTDESC38502;After four years, many in Zanzibar came to believe that their continued subordinate status to Oman made little sense given Zanzibar's greater wealth. Should we proclaim our full independence from Oman?
EVTDESC38503;Four years after Sultan Said's death, Majid refused to pay the tribute to his brother Thuwaini. With the help of the British under Lord Canning, the Viceroy of India, a deal was reached which recognised Zanzibari independence in return for a tribute.
EVTDESC3900;The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. Workers of the World, unite!'\n\nUnionism is spreading like wildfire in some parts of our country. More and more agitators seem to be showing up at factory doors, arguing for workers to unionise and rise in opposition to what they describe as the capitalist system of exploitation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law does not allow for the lawful establishment of trade unions at present, but some members of our cabinet argue that it is, perhaps, best to change that.
EVTDESC3901;And, because the opinions of our men of labour need to be given a clear and unambiguous medium of expression, membership in the union should be made mandatory for all employees of the state'\n\nA strong political current in parliament have begun arguing for mandatory association with the National Union for any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public employee. The suggestion has received some support from circles within the trade union movement, and many are arguing that the suggestion might serve as a good compromise with those who argue for further liberalisation of the trade union laws. What is the government's position?
EVTDESC3902;A so-called 'Friendly Society' has been established in one of our provinces. The Friendly Society is a loose association of people, often working in the same or similar trades as each other, dedicated to providing members with mutual economic assistance in the forms of unemployment insurance, loans and cooperative banking. The Friendly Society claims that it isn't a trade union, but rather a cooperative or a bank, but some hawks within the cabinet fear that the organization is merely a front for socialist union activities, and should be shut down.
EVTDESC3903;So, I was thinking me and my boys could go down to the factory and talk to some people. You know, tell them about the law, and peace and quiet, and order. You know, rough a few feathers up to get the point across. These wildcats need rough love.'\n\nWe have been approached by a several employers' associations with a petition to clearly legalize lock-out and union busting practices. The cabinet is divided on the issue, but the more pro-business factions of it are definitely arguing in favor of the idea, with some even going so far as to suggesting restrictions on the right to establish unions.
EVTDESC4000;Slavery, this most vile and ancient institution of despotism and tyranny, is all but abolished in most of the civilized world, yet, here, in our very own $COUNTRY$, the practice continues with the explicit support of the law. An institution so clearly against the law of nature should not be given the false varnish of legality by men.'\n\nA rally has been held in one of our states by abolitionists, arguing for the abolishment of the institution of slavery, and freedom for slaves.
EVTDESC4001;Yes, here, in $COUNTRY$, all men are free and equal, but in lands beyond ours, the bonds of slavery and serfdom still wrap tightly around the wrists of the oppressed.'\n\nAbolitionists in $COUNTRY$ are arguing that the government should oppose slavery abroad, and support foreign abolitionist movements. Supporting foreign dissidents is obviously not something that will make us popular with the country on the receiving end.
EVTDESC4100;The streets have turned into rivers of people in one of our provinces, where every man, woman and child seems to have come out of the woodwork, and into the streets, to participate in a massive street protest directed directly against the government. The issue on the table is the appointed, undemocratic Upper House, and the masses are calling for reform and representation. Our options here are rather limited. Either we listen to the demands of the infuriated mob, or we risk angering the locals even further.
EVTDESC4101;Discontent has been brewing in broad stratas of the population for some time over the issue of our appointed upper house. Many people are disappointed with the poor representation afforded to them by the present representational system, and a long period of agitation has begun to form public opinion on the issue. Violent state wide protests have erupted in one of our states, and we need to decide what the government's position on the issue should be. Writing the question off completely will anger the population, and strengthen the local opinion against the appointed house. Making compromises will mean a strengthening of the liberal position in the Upper House, and will also anger conservatives.
EVTDESC4102;The people in one of our states feel that the present system of equal state representation in the Upper House leaves them underrepresented. Whether or not their disaffection is merely misdirected anger over something else, or something that they are actually upset about, is not entirely clear, but what is clear is that they are quite upset. Making compromises over these fairly vague complaints will doubtlessly be seen by the world as pandering to the faintest of winds, but not addressing the issue, now that it has come up, will probably anger the locals further. What is the government's position?
EVTDESC4103;The people in our populous states are very satisfied with the high representation afforded to them by our constitution. One of the states is particularly happy, as their candidates have, during the past year, managed to secure several local privileges for their state. In the grand scheme of things, it's not any matter that merits national attention, but they are happy nevertheless. The question is how we should capitalize on this sudden burst of public support. What should be the government's position?
EVTDESC4200;A professor at one of our most prestigious universities has published a tract on political philosophy. The tract argues in favor of a variant of the Jefferson method for appointing representatives to the Upper House. The Jefferson method is a highest averages method, and the purpose of it is to allocate seats in proportion to the number of votes a particular party list has received, by maintaining the ratio of votes received to seats allocated as close as possible. The tract has received a fair amount of both national and international attention. The publication gives us a window of opportunity to try to reform our voting system, but we could perhaps be content with some international prestige on account of the publication instead? What is the government's position?
EVTDESC4201;A nationwide political reform club has formed in $COUNTRY$. The club has made it its agenda to reform the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ voting system, and they have initially been able to gain a fair amount of political traction in the public debate. The club wants to see our Jeffersonian voting system replaced with one of proportional representation. The club argues that a proportional representation allows for a fairer and more balanced representation for the totality of our population, rather than for arbitrary political voting circles. With the amount of traction that the club has been able to garner, we would be hard pressed if we gave it no attention, on the other hand, reform might not be on our agenda right now.
EVTDESC4202;With the Upper House firmly in liberal hands, our population seems to have given us a clear and unequivocal mandate for political reform. This could be a good opportunity to reform our voting system, but the question is: In which direction? With the clear mandate we have, we could choose to go in more or less any direction, and the options that seem to lie on the table are a first past the post system and a Jeffersonian method. While we will still have to drag the reforms through our legislative bodies, this could be a good opportunity to build momentum.
EVTDESC4300;The mob assembled outside the national legislative assembly is frustrated and angry, and the anger is directed directly at us. Our population is up in ire over the issue of charter reform. They want the vote, and some hot-heads in the crowd are even hinting at taking it by force if they don't get it. Despite certain radicals, the movement for charter reform is still largely keeping itself within the bounds of peaceful protest. The options our government finds itself faced with are to either support the charter reform movement, or to oppose it, and the choice really shouldn't be too hard.
EVTDESC4301;Our voting system is heavily based on and around the ownership of land. A case has gained some notoriety in one of our states, where a young widow has been denied the voting rights tied to her estate, on account of the estate quickly losing market value due to falling prices in the area. The event has led to a wider discussion on the landed voting system in general, and several reform minded ideas are circulating in intellectual and progressive circles. The issue on the table is what stance the government should take on the case's principal issue. Should we attempt to fix voting indexes, and anger the poor strata of the local population, or allow them to fluctuate?
EVTDESC4302;Suffrage in $COUNTRY$ is directly based on the ownership of wealth and property. The fundamental principle is that only those who contribute to the common good should have a say in how that public good is managed and administered. One interesting consequence of this system has surfaced in one of our states, where several local merchants and traders from the middle classes have started earning enough to be allowed representation. Adjusting the rules will be seen as an adjustment to exclude certain social classes, and will not be appreciated by the richer classes. Disenfranchising the newly enfranchised middle classes risks a sharp rise in local militancy.
EVTDESC4303;A discussion is being held in one of our state assemblies on the issue of our wealth based voting system. Opponents argue that the present system is set by design to permanently and lastingly disenfranchise broad stratas of the population. We have the options of leaving the discussion, and hoping that it stays on a local level, or intervening to defend the present system, and raise the discussion to a national level.
EVTDESC4304;So, you see, it would be detrimental to the long-term peace and stability of our home state if the government were to announce that it seeks to support the calls for further voting reforms, that have elsewhere been voiced by slovenly revolutionary trash. Their screams are merely those of angry children.'\n\nOur government has been approached by a group of capitalists, aristocrats and other leading tycoons of local public life in one of our states. The group calls itself the Alliance of Concerned Citizens, and has sought the government's ear to inform it that there still are those who oppose any further reform to the political franchise. What should we tell them?
EVTDESC4305;People are getting along just fine in at least one of our provinces, it seems. A local political deadlock, that has persisted in one of our states since the last election, has been resolved in a compromise across party lines. With a compromise reached, the local political assemblies can get back to work. Locals are taking to the streets, celebrating the event as a great victory for democracy, and recalling those immortal words by Friedrich Schiller: 'Joy, beautiful sparkle of the gods, Daughter of Elysium. All men become brothers, where your tender wing lingers.'
EVTDESC43800;Charles Sturt, has returned from an attempt to locate the center of Australia. He has determined that the inland area does not have any large lakes nor an inland sea as was hoped.
EVTDESC43801;Seeking the reward for a south to north crossing of Australia, Robert Burke and William Wills were able to make it all the way to the Gulf of Carpentaria, only to perish at Coopers Creek on their return journey. Their base party had given them up for lost and left Coopers Creek only eight hours before their return.
EVTDESC43802;The Federal government announced that the prize of 200 pounds would be shared among five citizens who submitted essentially identical designs to the national flag design competition. There were over 32,000 entries in all.
EVTDESC43803;Beginning with the publication of The Man From Snowy River,  Patterson's stories painted a fascinating portrait of the Australian outback, and his song Waltzing Matilda has almost become the national anthem.
EVTDESC4400;It is my wish, therefore, that my collected fortune, in the forms of bonds, land, stocks and shareholds, be bequeathed to a foundation which is to further and advance the causes of human liberty, and freedom.'\n\nOurs is the era of Laissez-Faire. The free-trade policies our government embraces cause goods to flow across our borders, and wealth to flow into our coffers. As Adam Smith rightly predicted, an invisible hand seems to guide the fate of our nation toward a future of ever-increasing prosperity, and for the first time in centuries, famine is becoming a thing of the past. A wealthy trader has died in one of our states, and has bequeathed his fortune to advance the cause of free trade.
EVTDESC44000;With the opening of Hawaii to outside influence, new diseases arrived to plague the islands. Leprosy was among the scourges, and fearing the disease was highly communicable, a leper colony has been established on the island of Molokai to quarantine the victims. A Belgian missionary, Father Damien, has offered his services to oversee the colony and ensure its operation for the benefit of the victims.
EVTDESC4401;Barricades have been erected on Main Street, and bakery shop windows have been smashed, following spontaneous outbursts of looting. Food shortages are becoming ever more widespread in $COUNTRY$, and pent up anger is spilling onto the streets. Many blame our government's protectionist policies for the failures in the food market, and some are even calling for the cabinet to resign. We have two options for handling this crisis: Either we reshuffle the cabinet and hope to placate public opinion, or we bide our time and trust that our protectionist policies will be proven right in the long run.
EVTDESC4402;In $COUNTRY$, trade flows freely from one to the other, and few, if any, restrictions exist on trade between our merchants. In one of our neighbor countries, however, there still exists heavy import restrictions on wares and goods, and this is apparently especially true for weapons and firearms. Our two systems have locked horns in one of our border provinces, where a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchant has set up shop, trading weapons across the border. While we could inform our neighbor about the situation, we have very few legal means of stopping the merchant in question. After all, free trade applies to guns as well.
EVTDESC4403;One of our merchants has found himself in dire straits since the collapse of his family business. The business is, or was, a local powerhouse of industry, and many locals now find themselves without jobs and means of earning a living. While this is, prima facie, a tragedy, we could perhaps do something about it. Our government's policy of economic interventionism allows us to use public means to support fledgling or failing businesses. We could intervene in this situation, and support the business.
EVTDESC4404;...and here we have the bureau chief for the private sector'\n\nOur state industries have, for quite some time, been plagued by inertia and corruption. The result of these evils is a lack of clothes, soap and in some cases even food. With the everyday needs of our population left unsatisfied, it is a mere question of time until we begin seeing some serious displays of dissatisfaction from our population. What is becoming abundantly clear is that we need to deal with these problems.
EVTDESC4405;The bureau of economic planning has reported a gross miscalculation in last year's mid-term plan, leading to a severe over-reporting of military goods in our national stock-pile. It has not been easy to find out how this error came about, since everyone in the administration seems to have their hands full with pushing the blame. We could attempt to recover our 'losses' by enacting pay-cuts and rationalizations within the administration and the bureaucracy, but we can not expect a move like that to become popular.
EVTDESC4406;...it is, therefore, the solemn duty of any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen to, in this her darkest hour, support her country with whatever means possible, with any means at his disposal, with any means necessary'\n\nOne of the nation wide publications that exists in our country has published an opinion editorial in support of our government's Jingoistic war policy. This is of course excellent news, and the question is how we should leverage this publication to gain maximum benefit from it.
EVTDESC4407;Our armed forces have conducted a major recruitment drive across the entire country, and recruits have been flocking to the banners. The drive could not have been conducted, says the military, without the government's policy of strong support for the military. We can channel the positive public relations from this drive to either reduce our people's war exhaustion, or to push for further military gains.
EVTDESC4408;...and it seems to me an outright travesty that, while our people labour under the crushing yokes and fetters of poverty, unsanitary living conditions, and moral degradation, our parliament insists on spending thousands upon thousands upon millions on gunpowder and cannons. Our nation should go to war, gentlemen: A war on the ills that plague our society.'\n\nOne of our cabinet members has addressed parliament with a long speech expounding the government's anti-military policies. How should we leverage this?
EVTDESC4409;We stand before the defining issue, not only of our own time, but of all times. Do we continue to pull on the knots of war that the great nations of the world have tied between them, or do we, instead, lower our weapons and say, openly, that we desire peace, that we burn for peace, that we would die, for peace.'\n\nOur government's pacifist policies have gained a large amount of political traction both within parliament, and in the general population. This popular support can be cashed in, either by reducing militancy, or by further advancing the pacifist cause.
EVTDESC4410;Here we stand at the brink of a brave new world. Behind us lie a thousand years of darkness, criminal ignorance and superstitions. Before us lie a new future, free of all these evils. Here, at the fork in the road, we make our choice. God is dead, gentlemen! Do we now advance forward, in clear acceptance of the facts uncovered by the modern sciences, that there is not, and cannot be, a divine creator, or do we cling to our most beloved nightmare, and continue to close our eyes in trembling fear of demons, angels and ghosts of sins past. We are free people, gentlemen. Let us act our part.'\n\nOur government's anti-clerical agenda has, not surprisingly, caused friction with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clergy.
EVTDESC44100;In $YEAR$ $CULTURE_FIRST_NAME$ $CULTURE_LAST_NAME$ published 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' and completely revolutionized $COUNTRY_ADJ$ fiction. Up until its publication, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ fiction had tended to utilize the form and language of its European predecessors -- $CULTURE_LAST_NAME$ fired a shot in the name of linguistic independence by beautifully depicting the speech of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ illiterate and disenfranchised. The book was clearly an attempt to show how peoples of all kinds are worthy of respect due to their actions and not their status. At the time, it caused an uproar because of its unconventional form and its theme was mostly ignored. Even today people seem to miss the point.
EVTDESC44101;Engine #999 heading up the Empire State Express on the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad was clocked at a speed of 112 miles per hour.
EVTDESC44102;Presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan called for the minting of free silver, earning him nominations from the Populist, Silver Republican, National Silver and Progressive parties, and rallying western and southern farmers to a common cause for the first time since the class wars. His endorsement was viewed by northern industrialists as an attempt to sabotage creditors and break the trusts.
EVTDESC44103;The HMS Resolute was found adrift in the North Atlantic, after having been abandoned by the squadron in search of the lost polar explorer, Sir John Franklin. The United States bought the ship from salvagers, refitted the vessel and returned it to Great Britain.
EVTDESC44104;Politician and lawyer $CULTURE_FIRST_NAME$ $CULTURE_LAST_NAME$ began his reforms of the educational system of Massachusetts. His system of schools became a model for the entire $COUNTRY$.
EVTDESC44105;The $COUNTRY$ Congress founded the Smithsonian Institution which reports directly to the $MONARCHTITLE$. It's goals, according to our congressmen are: the support of research and expeditions, as well as the popularization of science.
EVTDESC44106;Ralph Waldo Emerson's first collection of 'Essays' was published in 1841 and introduced the world to a new, rather mystical, philosophy indigenous to the New World. Although many Europeans didn't consider him much of a philosopher per se, his influence on Continental thinking was unmistakable -- most significantly on Nietzsche.
EVTDESC44107;Oliver Wendell Holmes' has published The Common Law, a history of the common-law tradition. In it he asserted that law was not logical, but rather the will of the judge tempered by circumstances, or,  as its most famous maxim put it, The Life of the law has not been logic, but experience. It quickly became a classic and Holmes was appointed to a professorship at Harvard the next year and was eventually made a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The publication of The Common Law signalled the rise of pragmatism among American intellectuals and presaged a growing distrust of moralism after the horrible slaughter of the Civil War.
EVTDESC44108;Ulysses S. Grant has published his 'Personal Memoirs', which were a nearly complete retelling of his life. He wrote the book while suffering from throat cancer in order to try and guarantee his family a living after he died. Universally considered a masterpiece of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ letters, Grant's memoirs are distinctive for their directness, clarity and economy of style. Mark Twain compared it favorably with Caesar's 'Commentaries'. The 'Personal Memoirs' was a smashing success in its time and remains one of the few books continuously in print since the Civil War. It is probably the best book written by an $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ to date.
EVTDESC44109;Alfred Thayer Mahan has published 'The Influence of Sea Power on History', in which he analyzes the role of sea power in history. This could be embraced by those interested in expanding both the $COUNTRY$ Navy, and the $COUNTRY$ world-wide interests.
EVTDESC4411;It has, over the past few years, become ever more obvious to this observer, that the present marriage between church and state cannot long persist, in face of the ever more agonizing conflicts between them. Conflicts that I, for lack of better words, could refer to as incidents of domestic violence.'\n\nAn intermezzo in one of our states seems to have been caused by our ruling party's secular policies. The local clergy in the area has received government support for several charitable ventures. Among other things, the religious organizations have been allowed to rent public buildings at prices vastly below market value.
EVTDESC44110;Responding to growing antiwar and labour conscious sentiment among conscripts and the under-classes, Congress passed an amended version of the 1799 Alien and Sedition Acts, making it illegal to protest the President and national policies in a time of war and greatly undermining foreign nationals and asylum seekers. Upheld by the Supreme Court in several landmark rulings over the next decade, the laws would persist in varying forms until overturned by the Warren Court half a century later. During the First World War, all 168 members of the IWW's executive committees were arrested and tried, breaking the union forever.
EVTDESC44111;Pinkerton men, who have proven themselves effective at solving train robberies and capturing counterfeiters, have now turned to working as strike-breakers and infiltrating such secret societies as the Molly Maguires.
EVTDESC44112;Eight teams have banded to form a clean, well-run baseball league -- the Boston Red Caps, Chicago White Stockings, Cincinnati Reds, Hartford Dark Blues, Louisville Grays, New York Mutuals, Philadelphia Athletics, and St. Louis Browns.
EVTDESC44113;A fire that began in the barn at the residence of Patrick O'Leary on DeKoven Street spread throughout the business district, destroying 17,450 buildings, killing 300 people and leaving over 98,000 homeless.
EVTDESC44114;In a thirty-second gun fight in Tombstone, Arizona, Wyatt, Morgan and Virgil Earp along with Doc Holliday, killed Billy Clanton and Tom and Bob McLaury - three members of their political rivals, the Cowboys.
EVTDESC44115;In Cooperstown near New York the first public baseball game took place. The New York Knickerbockers lost to the New York Nine 1 - 23.
EVTDESC44116;A wave of religious zeal is sweeping across $COUNTRY$. Driven by charismatic preachers who called for the faithful to return to the original teachings of the Bible and lead upstanding moral lives, the movement has started to spawn several new Protestant sects, has led to debates and schisms within established sects over points of theology and ritual, and reinforce the power and influence of Christian teachings among the lower and middle classes of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.
EVTDESC44117;The rise of numerous sects within Protestant Christianity in the $COUNTRY$ in the early 19th Century would create an environment for further theological speculation. One of the most influential movements to arise from this would be American Unitarianism. Emphasizing the role of reason in understanding theology (and thus rejecting the concept of the Trinity) and the inherent goodness of humanity and its capability for improvement because of reason, Unitarianism would become very influential among middle and upper-class populations in the Northeastern $COUNTRY$ and encourage several movements of social improvement, from public education to abolitionism.
EVTDESC44118;One direct impact of the religious revival in the $COUNTRY$ is the explosion in the number of voluntary organizations organized to help improve society by tackling perceived social or moral problems in society, providing comfort to the less fortunate, or promoting self-help via education. Dubbed 'The Benevolent Empire' by historians, these organizations helped provide a community infrastructure for a society rapidly expanding in numbers and being transformed by new economic forces.
EVTDESC44119;As Bishop (and later Archbishop) of New York from 1842 to 1864, Hughes would work tirelessly to integrate Roman Catholics, particularly newly-arrived immigrant Catholics, into the fabric of American society while at the same time ensuring that the institutions and assets of the Catholic Church remained firmly under the control of the Catholic hierarchy.
EVTDESC4412;We are different. All of us, we who live within the sacred circle of $COUNTRY$, sing with our many, and varied voices. Yet we are all one and the same, for we are all $COUNTRY_ADJ$.'\n\nIt feels like a change in the wind. Old conflicts are being laid to rest, and bitter enemies can be seen arm in arm. It might sound like a fantasy, but the pluralist policies of our ruling party can almost be said to have ushered in a new era of understanding and tolerance in our nation. The calm might be deceptive, but it is calm.
EVTDESC44120;One of the impacts of the religious revival in the $COUNTRY$ in the early 19th Century would be sustained campaigns against perceived vices by those who believed they were doing God's work by attempting to stamp out such behavior. Saloons were often a favorite target of such crusaders, and on occasion saloons and their patrons would be physically attacked by zealots.
EVTDESC44121;Established in 1816 as by African-American members of the Methodist community of Philadelphia, in the 1830s and 1840s the AME Church would rapidly expand its membership among both free and slave populations in the United States during the era of religious revival, providing a spiritual outlet for the African-American community completely under their own control and direction and a new platform for challenging the continued practice of slavery in the Union.
EVTDESC4413;And the moral fiber of our nation has thus degenerated, now to the point where all the evils that are want to plague a society are allowed free reign and roam in ours. What we need, what we desperately must have, is a moral resurgence in $COUNTRY$. We must return to the old values, to the foundation, to the things that once made our country great.'\n\nA preacher in one of our states has started a small, but locally potent, organization dedicated to what it claims is a much needed moral restoration of $COUNTRY$. No doubt this organization is piggy-backing on the ruling-party's already established moralist policies, and, on account of that, the ruling party could probably use this organization as a vital local ally.
EVTDESC4414;But today, our high-quality goods are outcompeted by the cheapest vendor-trash that the foreign mass-producers can find to drown our market in. It is of the utmost importance, therefore, that we protect our local industries from the damaging influences of foreign competition.'\n\nOne of our states has faced heavy foreign competition in the past few year, and, as a response, a local protectionist lobby has formed. The lobby aims to impose subsidies to what it refers to as 'nationally vital industries', as well as import restrictions on foreign goods.
EVTDESC4415;And, in these days, when the old mercantilist dragon again rears its ugly head, it becomes more important than ever that those who do not wish to see borders closed and walls erected between the peoples of the world, speak their minds and make their voices resoundingly heard in the court of public opinion.'\n\nThe flames of public debate have been fanned today by the formation of a Free Trade Repeal society in one of our states. The society is dedicated to opposing the government's protectionist policies, and to repealing some of the central laws behind the government's policy.
EVTDESC4416;And, therefore, the issue of economic freedom must, in this instance, be separated from the broader issue of public morality. The free trade of goods across our borders means a constant influx of all filth, depravity and immorality, and this dirty flood that washes over our people, must be stopped.'\n\nA debate has flared up between moralists and free traders in one of our states. Moralists argue that our current free trade policies allow our traders and merchants too much leeway in the types of goods the purvey, and wish to see a ban enacted on goods deemed to constitute a threat to public morality.
EVTDESC4417;And, therefore, our nation's conflicts are also our conflicts. Not merely on account of the justness of our fatherland's cause, but also on account of the fundamental moral rightness for which it stands.'\n\nOur government's policies on issues of public morality have led to a massive support for the war effort from moralist circles. Some in these circles have even started to refer to $COUNTRY$'s conflict as a moral crusade.
EVTDESC4418;In light of the recent acts of violence committed by certain elements within our community, I, therefore, would like to suggest to this chamber a temporary abridgment of the right to assemble in public places. It is a well established fact that the heart of the city pulses along with the heart of the mob, and that by removing the mob, the city will return to calm.'\n\nA conservative clique in the Upper House has, on account on the prevailing social unrest in $COUNTRY$, begun pushing for what they refer to as a temporary ban on public meetings. While the ban is claimed to be temporary, many within the other parties fear that it may very well become institutionalized.
EVTDESC4419;I just want some bread. I've been standing here for four hours now. I don't think they have any bread.'\n\nThe queues can be seen snaking their way for blocks and blocks again. The government controlled food supplies have been having trouble coming in to one of our provinces, on account of inefficiencies and bureaucratic staleness in the Transport & Logistics departments. It is very clear that locals expect us and the central government to act and do something about it.
EVTDESC4420;I feel strongly that we have lost what I like to think of as our place in the sun. $COUNTRY$ used to be a respected force in the international community, but these days it is as if our voice was consequently, and by design, ignored. I feel that, in order to regain that which was lost, we must again assert ourselves on the international scene. Some might accuse me of adventurism, but, by Jingo, this country was built by adventurers.'\n\nThe politburo has held a meeting to discuss our international situation, and the mood around the table has been grim. Some of the more hawkish members of the buro are discussing a foreign campaign, to assert our international position, and to divert attention from internal dissent within the regime.
EVTDESC4421;With our campaign-workers harassed, our party headquarters closed and our officials disturbed in their work at every turn of the road, it comes as surprise to me that we still garner any votes at all! These policies of open political harassment are a shame. A blot of shame on our national conscience, a disgrace to our nation and an insult to what I, had it been that democratic elections were actually being held in $COUNTRY$, would refer to as our electorate.'\n\nLeading liberal politicians in one of our states have protested in fierce language against the harassment policies of our election system. The politicians are up in ire about this, and call upon the national government to react.
EVTDESC4422;And we will not accept the agitations of the capitalists and the war-profiteers, trying, with their vicious imperialist propaganda, to pit the workers of one country against the workers of another! The workers of the world are all brothers, and we all speak the same language. The sweat on a brother's brow is the sweat on ours, and the blood from a brother's heart, pumps through our veins! Capitalists, comrades, make the money, and we, comrades, spill the blood.'\n\nA strike has broken out in one of our provinces, organized by subversive elements within the trade-union movement. While the strike is officially organized under the parole of peace and solidarity, some in our cabinet suspect that the demonstration is a crypto-socialist manifestation of power.
EVTDESC4423;The Censorship Bureau has found itself swamped with work in the past few years, and the executive director of the bureau has complained on numerous occasions that his subordinates are incapable of keeping up with the constantly increasing amount of material coming in for review. The issue of the overworked bureau has now reached critical mass with the publication of an article expressing slanderous anti-government propaganda, bordering on personal libel directed at several cabinet members. When asked how the newspaper could pass the censorship process, The Censorship Bureau has pointed to several old reports detailing it's lack of resources. Several cabinet members, however, claim that the bureau has more than enough resources to handle the tasks assigned to it, and that the problems are fundamentally organizational.
EVTDESC4424;And this is what the wanton speculation of our so-called captains of industry has led to! Gentlemen, these are the results! Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, have been squandered away in high-risk investments, speculative real-estate purchases and bonds that, upon closer inspection, hold no real value save that of hot air. I call upon this assembly to step in and rectify these issues, with a strong policy of regulation and government intervention.'\n\nA member of parliament has criticized our government's economic policy, citing a series of failed investments allegedly made by the private sector.
EVTDESC4425;One has to wonder what went through their minds. To publish a text like this in a country like $COUNTRY$? In any event, what is done is done. A widely circulated $COUNTRY_ADJ$ daily has published a blasphemous text containing a scathing denunciation of all things religious. The text is written by a member of our intelligentsia of some renown, and is perhaps a sign of the godless times we live in. Moralists demand that the text be retracted with a formal apology issued to the offended religious institutions, while several members of the reform-minded elites argue that the author was simply exercising his right to free speech. After all, the press is free in $COUNTRY$, so there is a case to be made.
EVTDESC44300;After the Conservative administration had been voted into majority in Parliament in 1872, charges were levied against John A. Macdonald of the most serious nature. Macdonaldes pet project had been the trans-continental railway, and the Liberal administration charged that Sir Hugh Allan had given him campaign funds in exchange for a guaranteed contract with his company, Canadian Pacific. Despite Macdonaldes claims of innocence, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister. Donald A. Smithes lack of confidence in Macdonald only further contributed to the decline of the partyes popularity
EVTDESC44301;The Metis people were a group of small communities of French-Indian blood in the Manitoba region who had hopes of self-government. Unfortunately their dreams were shattered when the Hudson's Bay land, which they were a part of, were given to Canada without their consent. In protest the Metis people, led by Louis Riel, revolted. Louis Riel was a highly religious man, who had studied for the clergy in his earlier life. He fought for the Metis people and became a hero in the eyes of Manitobans. Louis bargained with the Canadian government for Manitoba's entry into Confederation. Canadian delegates guaranteed the rights of the people would be respected. Thus, Manitoba, the postage-stamp province, was born.
EVTDESC44302;Although the Canadian government promised to respect the rights of the Metis, it did not appear to do so. Metis petitions for recognition of their land-holdings and institutions went unheeded. The Metis also became increasingly upset with the growing numbers of settlers from the east, invading their territories. In early 1885, the situation came to a head when the Metis once again took up arms in revolt. Adopting the Revolutionary Bill of Rights, the Metis established their own government and independence from Canada. Canadian troops came and crushed the rebellion. Louis Riel was tried and executed. The Metis would not be recognized officially as a people until a hundred years later.
EVTDESC44800;Francisco Madero issued a statement condemning the recent elections as a fraud, and claiming that Porfirio Diaz was no longer the legitimate president of Mexico. Madero called for citizens to take up arms against Diaz.
EVTDESC44801;Francisco Madero convinced Pascual Orozco and Francisco Villa to rise in support of removing Diaz.
EVTDESC44802;Emiliano Zapata led a revolt of peasants in the province of Oaxaca.
EVTDESC44803;Jose Posada's satirical cartoons of the present regime have landed him in jail once again.
EVTDESC45000;President Baez has sent negotiators to explore the possibility of annexation of the Dominican Republic to the United States. Effectively it would give up independence.
EVTDESC45001;The Dominican Republic is seeking annexation by the United States.
EVTDESC45002;Representatives of the Dominican Republic have offered annexation, and suggested joining our union as a state!
EVTDESC45003;President Baez has sent negotiators to explore the possibility of annexation of the Dominican Republic to France. Effectively it would give up independence.
EVTDESC45004;The Dominican Republic is seeking annexation by France.
EVTDESC45005;Representatives of the Dominican Republic have made us the offer of annexing their nation.
EVTDESC45006;After a decade of general stability, the assassination of President Ulises Heureaux revealed that the many deals he made with foreign banks has left the country bankrupt.
EVTDESC45100;Relations with the Church were improved through the Concordat of 1860, which allows the return of French clergy and the establishment of parochial schools.
EVTDESC45101;Faustan Soulique, the compromise candidate for President in 1847, declared himself the second emperor of Haiti as Faustin I.
EVTDESC46300;Antonio de Castro Alves published O Navio Negreiro, and soon earned the sobriquet of poet of the slaves. His work was influential for the abolition of slavery in Brazil.
EVTDESC46301;In $YEAR$ the Paulista $CULTURE_FIRST_NAME$ $CULTURE_LAST_NAME$ came back from England, where he had studied, with two footballs, a book of rules, a set of uniforms and the experience of having learned the sport invented by the English. $COUNTRY_LAST_NAME$ and other English resident in Seo Paulo played the first match in Brazil in $YEAR$, with the employees of the Gas Company playing against employees of the Seo Paulo Railway. The match was played in the valley of Carmo, and the employees of the railroad company won 4-2. Since then, the interest of Brazilians for the sport has increased dramatically.
EVTDESC46302;Francisco Sabino, a military officer, launched a radical revolt in Bahia, calling for the end of slavery and the redistribution of land.
EVTDESC46400;The noted journalist and leader of the Colorado Party, Jose Batlle y Ordonez achieved the passage of strong legislation for political reform in Uruguay.
EVTDESC46600;Alberdi's book, Bases for the Political Organization of the Argentine Republic , first published in 1852, the year of Rosas' defeat, became the framework for the new Argentine constitution. The Argentine constitution that Alberdi crafted was modeled on that of the United States.
EVTDESC46601;This book, first published in 1845, used the story of the dictator Facundo, to expose an opposition between European 'civilization' and native 'barbarism'. As angry and condemning as Sarmiento was towards Facundo Quiroga, Rosas, and the people of the Pampas, there emerged in the book a wonderful, and at times admiring portrait of that part of Argentina that Sarmiento believed had to be killed off.
EVTDESC46800;American explorer Hiram Bingham, discovered the remains of the lost Inca city of Macchu Picchu in 1911.
EVTDESC46801;Agricultural fertilizers processed from guano is now in great demand in Europe and North America. The deposits of guano on our offshore islands could become a major benefit to our nation.
EVTDESC48300;Our duke was the nearest relative in the succession of the Duchy of Anhalt-Kethen in 1847, and became the successor to Alexander Karl, Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg, who did not have a direct heir. Anhalt was at last united under one duke.
EVTDESC5000;In a hard fought thrilling game, the first FA cup was today played at the Kensington Oval in London. In a surprise result, the $PROVINCENAME$ Albion won with 1-0 over Queens Park. The Spiders showed a lot of sportsmanship during the game, but eventually lost to a goal by Alfred Goodwyn in the second half.
EVTDESC5001;Uruguay have just hosted the first World Cup of Football, which was a stellar success. Even though not many countries managed to travel here from Europe, there were still great football played. And what was most important of all, Uruguay won the final 4-2 over Argentina!
EVTDESC5002;Lord Stanley of Preston was very intrigued by ice hockey as he became Governor-General of the Dominion. Originally inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy was donated in 1892 by him, as an award for Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club. 
EVTDESC60000;By parliamentary class struggle, and as effect of intensified class struggle on account of the increasing exploitation of the proletariat by the capitalist classes, the gradual concentration of the means of production in the hands of the few, a club and a revolver, our so called democracy has now transformed into a dictatorship of the proletariat.
EVTDESC60010;The power of the presidential office has grown to the extent where it is no longer meaningful to keep up the illusions of democracy. Our nation is a presidential dictatorship, and the president, is you. Viva El Presidente!
EVTDESC60020;In the interests of protecting the principles of liberty from the crushing onslaught of democracy, plebian aristocracy and mob rule, a committee of concerned citizens have seized power and transformed the country into a minimal government dictatorship. It's only temporary, they say.
EVTDESC60030;The voting rights have been curtailed, the party system gradually slips under state control, and, just yesterday, a bill on the expansion of the extraordinary powers of the state passed the house. The signs are clear and plain. The fascist ruling party has transformed our nation from a democracy to a fascist dictatorship.
EVTDESC60040;Your Majesty, on account of the unstable parliamentary situation, we see no other option than to declare a restoration of the crown to the principles of absolute monarchy. The principles and documents of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ constitutionalism are, effective immediately, declared null and void. Long live the king!
EVTDESC60050;The dictatorship is not what it used to be. Increased pluralism, combined with extended political reforms, have led to the dictatorship more and more taking on the trappings of a democracy. While this doesn't necessarily mean that the party has given up it's reign on power, it does mean that the opposition now has some chance of making its voice heard.
EVTDESC60060;The political reforms enacted in the past few years have led to a situation where the absolutism of our Monarchy can now legitimately be called into question. No longer is the king free to dictate the course of the nation to his own musings, but instead has had to accept several constitutional hems and restrictions on his exercise of power. For these reasons, our government form is no longer most accurately described as an absolute monarchy.
EVTDESC60070;The sweeping reforms to our party system that have been enacted during the past few years have turned our country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy. The Monarch, now serving as a symbolic head-of-state, no longer has the power to personally control and determine the fate of the nation, but is instead forced to accept the mitigating influences of pluralism and limited democracy.
EVTDESC60080;Lately an eerie feeling has crept over you that $COUNTRY$ is growing silent. Where before the free exchange of opinion and ideas could be heard, from street corners and bus stops to bars and universities, now only the sounds of silence gives echo. The conclusion that is becoming ever more evident, is that the tradition of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ democracy has been subverted. In $COUNTRY$, at least, the government for, of and by the people, has perished from the earth.
EVTDESC60120;A sentiment of cultural nationalism is sweeping $COUNTRY$, as people begin to clamor for unification with our cultural brethren in $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$. We have little reason to doubt that they would object to a petition of annexation.
EVTDESC60130;Following a surge in popular nationalist sentiments, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has placed a formal request with our authorities in $CAPITAL$ that they be allowed to join $COUNTRY$ in perpetual union. There seems to be little reason to oppose this move.
EVTDESC60140;With the liberals firmly in control of our country, they feel that now is the time for a constitutional convention. Everyone's views, well at least everyone who truly matters, will be represented in this new gathering to shape the path of our nation.
EVTDESC60150;With the recent rollback of voting reforms, the fairer sex is once again denied the vote.
EVTDESC70000;Another astounding victory for $COUNTRY$ today, as it has now become clear that $STATE$ will, as has been expected for some time, be taken up into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patrimony with full rights of national statehood. One question that still remains to settle is, however, the issue of slavery. Slavery can be extended within our country, and the question on the table is whether we wish to extend the institution to $STATE$, or not?
EVTDESC70001;Another astounding victory for $COUNTRY$ today, as it has now become clear that $STATE$ will, as has been expected for some time, be taken up into the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patrimony with full rights of national statehood.
EVTDESC90000;As everyone knows, $CB_TARGET_NAME$ is out to get us. It's only a matter of time before they launch an unprovoked attack, so it is only reasonable that we take steps to pre-emptively defend ourselves. As luck would have it, a report detailing their nefarious schemes has recently been eleakede to the press, and the public have rallied to our cause.
EVTDESC90001;In a rather embarrassing blunder, several of our soldiers in the uniform of $CB_TARGET_NAME$ have been caught while trying to sneak across the border. While the rumours that their task was to stage a border incident to justify our invasion are totally unfounded, it would be wise not to provide any fresh fuel for the fire right now.
EVTDESC90002;For too long people have suffered under the malign influence of $CB_TARGET_NAME$. For the good of all involved we must reveal the evidence of $CB_TARGET_NAME$'s mismanagement to the world and bring their Sphere members under our wing for their own good.
EVTDESC90003;Despite having very much non-made-up proof that $CB_TARGET_NAME$ are up to no good there seems to be no public or international support for rescuing the poor lesser nations from their sphere of influence.
EVTDESC90004;Without the protection of a Great Power such as ourselves anything could happen to $CB_TARGET_NAME$. In order to protect them they must be added to our Sphere of Influence, despite any short-term objections they might have. After all, if they any sense they would be Great powers too.
EVTDESC90005;Although we only want to help $CB_TARGET_NAME$ by adding them to our sphere of influence they have gotten very worked up about it. While unseemly to all involved, their behaviour has rather turned international opinion against forcefully requesting they join us in our prosperity. Although we only want to help $CB_TARGET_NAME$ by adding them to our sphere of influence they have gotten very worked up about it. While unseemly to all involved, their behaviour has rather turned international opinion against forcefully requesting they join us in our prosperity.
EVTDESC90006;Why should $CB_TARGET_NAME$ get all the prime colonial land? It's downright unfair, that's what it is! They probably aren't even properly exploit- educating the native population! Something must be done, we deserve our place in the sun!
EVTDESC90007;Despite the modest nature of our just demands, there seems to be no international support for re-adjusting the colonial balance between ourselves and $CB_TARGET_NAME$. While this is a setback, we have no doubt that one day we will possess and empire that the sun never sets on.
EVTDESC90008;$CB_TARGET_NAME$ is getting too big for their boots, as all can agree. For too long they have been strutting around the world stage, thinking they can do as they will. Thankfully, at last the rest of the world agrees, and our population is solidly behind us: $CB_TARGET_NAME$ must be taken down a peg or two.
EVTDESC90009;While the hubris of $CB_TARGET_NAME$ is evident to us, apparently others fail to see it. Their so-called esovereigntye apparently allows them to have their own army and to do as they will without deferring to us. It has even been implied that we are the arrogant ones!
EVTDESC90040;India has risen in rebellion!
EVTDESC90100;The People long for a Free Press, and as our neighbours adopt this reform it makes their longing all the stronger.
EVTDESC90101;Despite our promise to reform the press, nothing has changed and the people are somewhat upset.
EVTDESC90102;The People long for the right to Public Meetings, and as our neighbours adopt this reform it makes their longing all the stronger. 
EVTDESC90103;Despite our promise to allow public meetings, nothing has changed and the people are somewhat upset.
EVTDESC90104;The People long for Trade Unions, and as our neighbours adopt this reform it makes their longing all the stronger. 
EVTDESC90105;Despite our promise to allow trade unions, nothing has changed and the people are somewhat upset.
EVTDESC90900;"We are now sufficently advanced for the European barbarians to regard us as ""Civilised"", and so they must respect our right to centralise and reject foreign influence throughout China."
EVTDESC90901;The Qing's new status has lead them to demand we submit to their authority, accepting will mean an end to our independant existence.
EVTDESC90902;China has fractured.

EVTOPTA1003;Okay.
EVTOPTA10050;We pray for the fallen
EVTOPTA10100;Let them eat cake!

EVTOPTA10110;Bloody revolutionaries.
EVTOPTA10120;I hope I'm not in the obituaries.
EVTOPTA10130;Oh great.
EVTOPTA10140;...maybe that is what they want us to think?
EVTOPTA10150;Send in the troops
EVTOPTA10160;Time to crack down on them.
EVTOPTA10170;We shall consider it
EVTOPTA10180;Interesting
EVTOPTA10190;He sounds like a reasonable man!
EVTOPTA10200;Send in the troops
EVTOPTA10210;Blast!
EVTOPTA10220;Good riddance.
EVTOPTA10230;Quarantine the province
EVTOPTA10240;He was out drinking last night?
EVTOPTA10250;Say nothing
EVTOPTA10260;Excellent!
EVTOPTA10270;They must be allowed to express their opinions
EVTOPTA10280;Honestly, have you nothing better to do?
EVTOPTA10290;Make sure it stays a local hit at best
EVTOPTA10300;Perhaps some slight adjustments locally could be considered
EVTOPTA10320;Obviously we must take pride in this publication!
EVTOPTA10330;Let them hold their little rally.

EVTOPTA12030;Cover their losses
EVTOPTA1204;Ok
EVTOPTA12040;Crops do not grow themselves, sadly.
EVTOPTA1205;Ok
EVTOPTA12050;Accept the loss
EVTOPTA1206;Ok
EVTOPTA12060;Stockpile the food
EVTOPTA1207;Ok
EVTOPTA12070;... how long *could* it last?
EVTOPTA1208;Ok
EVTOPTA12080;The government will cover all losses
EVTOPTA1209;Good
EVTOPTA12090;There is nothing we can do.
EVTOPTA1210;Good
EVTOPTA12100;Only this province is affected
EVTOPTA1211;Good
EVTOPTA12110;Rock me in my cradle!
EVTOPTA1212;Good
EVTOPTA12120;Dig deep and greedily!
EVTOPTA1213;Good
EVTOPTA1214;Good
EVTOPTA12140;Let us celebrate!
EVTOPTA1215;Good
EVTOPTA12150;Reimburse the widows with pensions.
EVTOPTA1216;Good
EVTOPTA12160;Social Responsibility!
EVTOPTA1217;Good
EVTOPTA12170;They shall not have dyed in vain!
EVTOPTA12180;The government accepts no responsibility
EVTOPTA12190;Buy the fuel
EVTOPTA12200;The interests of industry will prevail
EVTOPTA12210;Excellent!
EVTOPTA12220;Stockpile the extra tea
EVTOPTA12230;We have none to spare
EVTOPTA12240;... what's it worth to you?
EVTOPTA12250;Prioritize saving the rich neighborhoods
EVTOPTA12260;Our offices must be representative
EVTOPTA12270;We can still wear them, though...
EVTOPTA12280;Discard the rags
EVTOPTA130;Close down the bars!
EVTOPTA13000;Goodbye, $CONTINENTNAME$!
EVTOPTA13010;They are welcome to stay.
EVTOPTA13015;Our options are limited, and force of arms must be considered
EVTOPTA13020;Allow them to return home
EVTOPTA13030;Oh well...
EVTOPTA13040;Keep it small. Keep it simple. Keep it under control.
EVTOPTA13050;It is not our place to intervene
EVTOPTA13055;Blast!
EVTOPTA13060;It is not our place to intervene
EVTOPTA13065;That's the spirit!
EVTOPTA13070;Why, that is excellent!
EVTOPTA13080;The foreigner is ignorant, not malevolent
EVTOPTA13090;Our research will blossom.
EVTOPTA13100;Oh darn.
EVTOPTA13110;Sounds good!
EVTOPTA13120;Enjoy the conversations, but ultimately do nothing
EVTOPTA13130;Certainly! Our troops need to modernize
EVTOPTA13140;Blast!
EVTOPTA13160;Hand him over to the foreigners
EVTOPTA13170;Dispatch a punitive expedition
EVTOPTA13180;We are pleased
EVTOPTA13190;Reform the military
EVTOPTA13200;We bide our time
EVTOPTA13201;By Jingo!
EVTOPTA13210;Push for reform
EVTOPTA13220;They'd better appreciate this
EVTOPTA13230;Grudgingly erect a monument to the diplomat
EVTOPTA13240;Turn the ship away
EVTOPTA13250;Free Trade is Fair Trade!
EVTOPTA13260;Bending with the wind is also a form of resistance
EVTOPTA13270;Huzzah!
EVTOPTA13280;Blast!
EVTOPTA13290;Major reform!
EVTOPTA13300;Open a bombard with whatever is available
EVTOPTA13305;A matter that merits national attention, I'm sure
EVTOPTA13310;False teachings!
EVTOPTA13320;Interesting...
EVTOPTA13330;Excellent!
EVTOPTA13340;I see pillars of smoke...
EVTOPTA13352;Indeed...
EVTOPTA13355;We weep for our loss
EVTOPTA13356;This is an outrage!
EVTOPTA13360;Interesting.
EVTOPTA13400;Let's have a seat!
EVTOPTA13410;Excellent!
EVTOPTA13420;Interesting
EVTOPTA140;Order the saloon closed
EVTOPTA14000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition
EVTOPTA14010;Decisive arguments for Laissez Faire
EVTOPTA14020;There are no Gods!
EVTOPTA14030;Give them residency.
EVTOPTA14040;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!
EVTOPTA14050;Raise the tariffs!
EVTOPTA14060;Free trade ensures our long term competitive edge
EVTOPTA14070;I see no reason to monopolize it.
EVTOPTA14080;Nonsense. The production quota will remain the same.
EVTOPTA14090;Naturally, they are right.
EVTOPTA14100;That's rubbish!
EVTOPTA14110;Religion is a private matter.
EVTOPTA14120;Secularization first!
EVTOPTA14130;Try to keep an open mind.
EVTOPTA14140;Of course the church must be renovated!
EVTOPTA14150;They have no right to demand anything.
EVTOPTA14160;Limited citizenship until a proven and loyal subject
EVTOPTA14170;We must constantly strive to extend freedom!
EVTOPTA14180;To war, by Jingo!
EVTOPTA14190;The soldiers need better food!
EVTOPTA14200;That sounds expensive.
EVTOPTA14210;Peace always prevails!
EVTOPTA14500;Divert more water to local farms
EVTOPTA14510;We should open the colony up to free competition between any and all traders
EVTOPTA14520;Naturally, a new factory can only be a good thing
EVTOPTA14530;We must seek an effective, honest and diligent administration
EVTOPTA14540;The idea is certainly interesting, but it might be expensive.
EVTOPTA14550;A rousing cheer for the Empire!
EVTOPTA14560;We need to enact a more comprehensive education policy
EVTOPTA14570;We make no concessions to threats and violence
EVTOPTA14580;Who gives a hoot about their religion anyway?
EVTOPTA14590;Lazy natives need to learn to adapt!
EVTOPTA14600;We must remain calm. This situation will pass.
EVTOPTA14610;Excellent!
EVTOPTA14620;Intervene immediately!
EVTOPTA14630;Leave it be. Hopefully the situation will resolve itself.
EVTOPTA14640;This is something, therefore it must be done!
EVTOPTA14650;Let us leave the lion sleeping in its jungle
EVTOPTA14660;This will reflect beautifully on us!
EVTOPTA14670;$COUNTRY$ apologizes for nothing
EVTOPTA14680;I support the idea wholeheartedly
EVTOPTA14690;My loyal subjects, you serve your country best at home!
EVTOPTA14700;It's a Bananza!
EVTOPTA14710;Get out of my hair you profiteering scumbags
EVTOPTA14720;The colonies are of vital importance to the nation
EVTOPTA14730;Denounce the League
EVTOPTA14740;Wonderful!
EVTOPTA14750;Conservative arguments prevail
EVTOPTA14760;The government must accept responsibility for its own shortcomings
EVTOPTA14770;...and may the memory live long
EVTOPTA14780;... who cares!?
EVTOPTA14790;Fantastic news!
EVTOPTA14800;Just display the baubles somewhere locally
EVTOPTA14810;If the shop needs to operate at those hours, who are we to have opinions about that?
EVTOPTA150;An expedient moment for temperance
EVTOPTA15000;$COUNTRY$ is occupied elsewhere at the moment
EVTOPTA15010;The policy stands
EVTOPTA15020;Leave him be
EVTOPTA15030;Mitigate the policies slightly
EVTOPTA15040;Control the clergy through legislative means.
EVTOPTA15050;They're $PROVINCECULTURE$! We have nothing to fear
EVTOPTA15060;Nationalize the bank
EVTOPTA15070;Speak softly
EVTOPTA15080;We fight them here
EVTOPTA15090;The runt got what he deserved
EVTOPTA15100;We are not provoked by this drivel
EVTOPTA15110;Curtail distribution
EVTOPTA15120;The die has been cast
EVTOPTA15130;Use $COUNTRYCULTURE$
EVTOPTA15140;No time to see them, sadly
EVTOPTA15150;Organize a crack-down
EVTOPTA15160;Arrrgh!
EVTOPTA15170;Round up the usual suspects
EVTOPTA15180;Support the movement
EVTOPTA15190;Do not intervene
EVTOPTA15200;Get rid of the ring-leaders
EVTOPTA15210;This man is clearly dangerous. Imprison him
EVTOPTA15220;Demand strict discipline
EVTOPTA15230;Secret Police to the rescue
EVTOPTA15240;Leave it be
EVTOPTA15250;Suppress the $PROVINCECULTURE$ rite
EVTOPTA15260;Yes, of course!
EVTOPTA15270;Rescind the building ban!
EVTOPTA15274;Rescind the building policy
EVTOPTA15280;Enforce the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Curricula
EVTOPTA15290;Reform the curricula
EVTOPTA15300;Not in $PROVINCENAME$ they don't!
EVTOPTA15310;Horrid. Absolutely horrid.
EVTOPTA160;The locals are free to do as they see fit
EVTOPTA16000;Three rousing cheers for the Union!
EVTOPTA160001;Crush them!
EVTOPTA16001;We can expect this issue to linger for some time
EVTOPTA16010;His soul is, indeed, marching on.
EVTOPTA16020;Worrying news
EVTOPTA16030;To our knights!
EVTOPTA16040;Of master...
EVTOPTA16050;Something for everyone!
EVTOPTA160502;A show of force should deal with this.
EVTOPTA16060;Something for everyone!
EVTOPTA16070;All men were created equal...
EVTOPTA16080;Let them sing
EVTOPTA16090;Leave them be
EVTOPTA16100;Leave them be
EVTOPTA16110;...so?
EVTOPTA16120;Nay!
EVTOPTA16130;The law is the law
EVTOPTA16140;Leave it be
EVTOPTA16150;We have more important concerns
EVTOPTA16160;Indeed
EVTOPTA16170;My Stamp Collectors act!
EVTOPTA16180;Let them settle
EVTOPTA16190;Grim news
EVTOPTA16200;A black day
EVTOPTA16210;A black day for $STATENAME$
EVTOPTA16220;Interesting
EVTOPTA16230;Grim news
EVTOPTA16240;Grim news
EVTOPTA16250;Rebel scum!
EVTOPTA16300;So this is the little lady...
EVTOPTA16310;Interesting
EVTOPTA16400;Trust the common man to get it right!
EVTOPTA16410;Rejoice!
EVTOPTA16415;They took my baby away!
EVTOPTA16420;Let us hope that this is their last stand.
EVTOPTA16430;R.I.P.
EVTOPTA16440;They will submit, sooner or later.
EVTOPTA16450;Hail to the Chief!
EVTOPTA170;Let them work undisturbed
EVTOPTA17000;There will be no suffrage at this junction
EVTOPTA17010;Use the secret police to contain these dangerous revolutionaries
EVTOPTA17020;This blatant discrimination is silly to the point of the absurd
EVTOPTA17030;Naturally the war-effort demands every available hand
EVTOPTA17040;The legal status of women in the work place obviously needs to be regulated
EVTOPTA17050;We watch, observe, learn, and, ultimately, do nothing.
EVTOPTA17060;Oh, well, freedom of speech and all that.
EVTOPTA17070;A good time to push for a more conservative agenda
EVTOPTA17080;... and the stock-market report?
EVTOPTA17090;I'm not sure how the locals will feel about all this littering. Not sure at all.
EVTOPTA17100;Throw that willy-nilly out of my institution of higher learning!
EVTOPTA17110;Commend the book
EVTOPTA17120;I predict that the reform agenda will gain a fair amount of traction in the Upper House
EVTOPTA17130;Okay.
EVTOPTA17140;I suggest that the local authorities force feed that hysterical woman
EVTOPTA17150;Use the pressure of the central government to end the legislation
EVTOPTA17160;Let us bask in the glow of this little gem of international renown that just fell into our lap
EVTOPTA17170;I might know of a little place that could decidedly get calmer...
EVTOPTA17500;We will not turn the arms of our soldiers against the citizens they exist to defend
EVTOPTA17510;We will not recommend our citizens to form protection rackets
EVTOPTA17520;You mean you fired someone? Nothing wrong with that!
EVTOPTA17530;Let us hope that this will be the end of this revolutionary prattle
EVTOPTA17540;Time is on our side. Let us wait them out with vague promises, but little or no action.
EVTOPTA17550;I shall suggest down at the club that they start a subscription. Gin, anyone?
EVTOPTA17560;Commemorating bomb-throwers and murderers, in one of *my* states?
EVTOPTA17570;And they say there is no leftist bias in the media... pfft.
EVTOPTA17580;An excellent initiative that can only be applauded!
EVTOPTA17590;Yes? We have trade, wars, production, and you tell me about organized labour?
EVTOPTA17600;An interesting development that we will make sure to keep an eye on.
EVTOPTA17610;Clamp down on the organization and attempt to shut it down
EVTOPTA17620;The party's work is not illegal, and is therefore not a government concern
EVTOPTA17630;Send out the military to restore order
EVTOPTA17640;Let them prance about if they absolutely must
EVTOPTA17650;I believe we will see it primarily read by the lower class
EVTOPTA17660;Declare Martial law and send in troops
EVTOPTA17670;Denounce the campaign
EVTOPTA17680;Allow them to prance about if they absolutely have to
EVTOPTA17690;Clowns in costumes are a local police matter
EVTOPTA17700;Declare the union illegal
EVTOPTA180;Let the shipment pass through
EVTOPTA18000;They do as they please
EVTOPTA18010;Liberal-Conservative
EVTOPTA18020;That does not make the deficiencies any less real
EVTOPTA18030;Lend it tacit support
EVTOPTA18040;That won't be necessary
EVTOPTA18050;Motion carries
EVTOPTA18060;The party-whips will bring them in line
EVTOPTA18070;Just as planned
EVTOPTA18080;Let them go
EVTOPTA18090;We need a bi-partisan solution
EVTOPTA18100;Stall the issue until the next election
EVTOPTA18110;Fortune favors the bold
EVTOPTA18120;Let them go.
EVTOPTA18130;What will be, will be
EVTOPTA18140;Do nothing
EVTOPTA18150;Stop the move
EVTOPTA18160;Things will get better
EVTOPTA18170;Maybe we have things to learn
EVTOPTA18180;Excellent!
EVTOPTA18190;By Jingo!
EVTOPTA18200;Push for laissez faire
EVTOPTA18500;Restore the calm
EVTOPTA18510;Modesty and justice
EVTOPTA18520;Let us not overextend
EVTOPTA18530;Hard work and toil!
EVTOPTA18540;Pride and Glory
EVTOPTA18550;Dispatch police forces
EVTOPTA18560;Let us forget
EVTOPTA18570;Remain calm, and take pride
EVTOPTA18580;Peace is on its way
EVTOPTA190;... where do I sign up?

EVTOPTA19027;Excellent!
EVTOPTA19028;Blast!
EVTOPTA19029;Yay!
EVTOPTA19030;$FROMCOUNTRY$ must renounce the title
EVTOPTA19031;The title is ours!
EVTOPTA19032;So it must be
EVTOPTA19033;Most fortunate
EVTOPTA19040;Go for it!
EVTOPTA19041;Excellent!
EVTOPTA19042;Bah!
EVTOPTA19043;Bribes are the way forward
EVTOPTA19044;Fantastic!
EVTOPTA19045;What next? Comet sighted?
EVTOPTA19046;Glorious!
EVTOPTA19047;Orphans Rejoice!
EVTOPTA19200;This reeks of foul play...
EVTOPTA19300;I lift my lamp beside the golden door
EVTOPTA19310;Excellent!
EVTOPTA19320;Banzai!
EVTOPTA19355;God help us all
EVTOPTA19356;Gentlemen, all I ask for is war, a war so grand as to make Hell itself tremble

EVTOPTA19501;Merits due consideration
EVTOPTA2000;A victory for our tolerant society!
EVTOPTA20000;Yes, we are interested in this crisis
EVTOPTA2010;Ignore them.
EVTOPTA20100;Of course not!
EVTOPTA20102;He's quite right, only war will solve this!
EVTOPTA20103;Rattle our sabre!
EVTOPTA20104;It's ours!
EVTOPTA20105;Press our Claim!
EVTOPTA2020;We wish them all the best
EVTOPTA2030;Change to Anja Jessek'
EVTOPTA2040;Let us speed this up.
EVTOPTA2050;Interesting, let us listen to them...
EVTOPTA2060;A police matter at worst
EVTOPTA2070;Welcome home, countrymen.
EVTOPTA2080;I'm not sure we can be bothered
EVTOPTA2090;They must be integrated, by force if necessary
EVTOPTA2100;Dire news!
EVTOPTA21000;*cough* *cough*
EVTOPTA21010;We must aid those starving!
EVTOPTA21020;Stuff breaks, people die
EVTOPTA21030;Fight the disease with every available means
EVTOPTA21040;Do whatever we can. Every life is precious!
EVTOPTA2110;Bragging rights +1!
EVTOPTA2120;Try to assure them that all is well
EVTOPTA2130;Pasta!
EVTOPTA21500;Eeep!
EVTOPTA21510;Eeep!
EVTOPTA21520;Eeep!
EVTOPTA22000;The whip cracks out of love!
EVTOPTA22010;No one escapes from Azazel's Atoll!
EVTOPTA22011;Oh well, it had to be so
EVTOPTA22020;The prisons are dirty for a reason, sweetie.
EVTOPTA22030;Demand that police produce a perpetrator
EVTOPTA22040;We need to consider more humane forms of punishment
EVTOPTA22050;Search High!
EVTOPTA22060;It can certainly be considered
EVTOPTA22070;The issue deserves due consideration
EVTOPTA22080;I shall certainly be happy to meet with them
EVTOPTA22500;Regulate! Tax! Ban! Panic!
EVTOPTA22510;It's only a temporary crisis, no one can be blamed
EVTOPTA22520;There is always the chance that these systems will fail, and then what?
EVTOPTA22530;Of course we must aid and help promote this beautiful private initiative
EVTOPTA22540;Splendid news!
EVTOPTA22550;The institution of free banking is a fundamental pillar of free trade
EVTOPTA22560;Excellent!
EVTOPTA22570;Naturally we must aid the company through this tough time
EVTOPTA22580;We must protect our workers at any cost, and this cornered market must be opened.
EVTOPTA23200;We should outfit an expedition.
EVTOPTA23201;We should try again.
EVTOPTA23203;A glorious day for science in our nation!
EVTOPTA23212;Thank God we live in such enlightened times
EVTOPTA23213;Well this isn't good...
EVTOPTA23450;A grand gesture by a great Swedish personality
EVTOPTA23451;A great honor for the study of physics in our nation.
EVTOPTA23491;A great honor for the study of chemistry in our nation.
EVTOPTA23531;A great honor for medical research in our nation.
EVTOPTA23571;A great honor for the literary tradition in our nation.
EVTOPTA23611;A great honor for our nation and the goals of global peace.
EVTOPTA2500;Regardless of their actions, this can be used as a justification for war
EVTOPTA2510;We cannot allow this treacherous act of barbarism to go unpunished!
EVTOPTA2520;Inform them of the potential consequences of continued non-cooperation
EVTOPTA2530;An invasion through there, and then deploy the troops so and so... interesting
EVTOPTA2540;Intolerable! Forceful action must certainly be considered
EVTOPTA2550;This must be given serious consideration
EVTOPTA2560;Long live $COUNTRY$!
EVTOPTA2570;Yes!
EVTOPTA29900;Truly, 'tis.
EVTOPTA29901;Brilliant!
EVTOPTA29902;Kaboom!
EVTOPTA29903;Excellent!
EVTOPTA29904;Let us not dig too deep and greedily, though.
EVTOPTA3000;Call for a parliamentary investigation.
EVTOPTA30000;An excellent idea! We accept.
EVTOPTA30001;A great spectacle for the world to enjoy!
EVTOPTA30003;A great spectacle for our region to enjoy!
EVTOPTA30005;A grand display of the power and wealth of our empire!
EVTOPTA3001;Fold completely and revoke the reform
EVTOPTA3002;Lots of rural charm!
EVTOPTA3003;Back local Conservatives
EVTOPTA3004;That's what I call private initiative!
EVTOPTA3005;Fund a local sanitarium
EVTOPTA3006;Abandon the Bill
EVTOPTA3100;Stop publishing this nonsense!
EVTOPTA3101;This scandalous slander ends!
EVTOPTA3102;Do not deny the rumors
EVTOPTA31100;Fascinating!
EVTOPTA31101;We welcome the German investment.
EVTOPTA31102;We have been ultimately driven from Europe...
EVTOPTA31300;Good to know!
EVTOPTA31301;That was close
EVTOPTA31302;A new age of communications in Switzerland
EVTOPTA31303;The vox populi has spoken.
EVTOPTA31306;Order must be restored in Ticino.
EVTOPTA31307;This could become an example for others. Or the state?
EVTOPTA31308;Controversial ideas spreading.
EVTOPTA31310;An idea long overdue
EVTOPTA31311;Naturally we shall sign this humanitarian document of progress
EVTOPTA31501;It doesn't taste, anyways!
EVTOPTA31502;Long live the Emperor! 
EVTOPTA31503;Let them speak Hungarian, if it makes them feel better.
EVTOPTA3200;Shut it down
EVTOPTA3201;Water and bread for three months!
EVTOPTA3202;Redraw the Constituency!
EVTOPTA3203;Just because you're paranoid...
EVTOPTA3204;The conservatives won, fair and square
EVTOPTA32500;A tragic death
EVTOPTA32501;So? Poland shall be kept off the map.
EVTOPTA32502;Serves him right!
EVTOPTA32503;To the glory of the Czar!
EVTOPTA32504;Ah, sweet music!
EVTOPTA32505;Sometimes two plus two must equal five.
EVTOPTA32506;You can't stop the progress!
EVTOPTA32507;We'll trade with Japan!
EVTOPTA32508;A fantastic production!
EVTOPTA32509;We have more bad climate than we need anyway
EVTOPTA32510;Excellent!
EVTOPTA32511;Blast!
EVTOPTA3300;Force through reform
EVTOPTA33000;Amazing!
EVTOPTA33001;Lions, zebras and elephants for everyone!
EVTOPTA33002;Finally, the language will now be unified, too.
EVTOPTA33004;We must make Schleswig German!
EVTOPTA33005;We will fund it!
EVTOPTA3301;Argue for a pension raise
EVTOPTA3302;I agree that certain revisions are in order
EVTOPTA3303;...and?
EVTOPTA3304;Get rid of the cruft
EVTOPTA3305;I concur with the good Sirs
EVTOPTA3306;Promise Post-War Pensions
EVTOPTA3307;A limited reform is what we can do
EVTOPTA33300;A tragedy!
EVTOPTA33400;Marvellous!
EVTOPTA33401;Scandalous!
EVTOPTA33402;Art for everyone!
EVTOPTA33403;An artistic genius
EVTOPTA33800;Tragic!
EVTOPTA33801;A tragedy!
EVTOPTA33802;Ahoy!
EVTOPTA33900;We are now part of Hanover
EVTOPTA33901;The lands of Hanover reunited
EVTOPTA3400;...and?
EVTOPTA3401;On the contrary, we need to lower subsidies
EVTOPTA3402;Ignore the Taxpayer's Committee.
EVTOPTA3403;What do they want? Unemployment subsidies? Fine.
EVTOPTA3404;Allow the union boss to mediate
EVTOPTA34100;They shall sing, not debate!
EVTOPTA34500;God save the Grand Duke!
EVTOPTA34600;Interesting ideas, nevertheless!
EVTOPTA34601;A Dreamer!
EVTOPTA34602;Long live the King! 
EVTOPTA34603;Exotic animals! 
EVTOPTA34604;All our citizens shall have equal duties!
EVTOPTA34605;And then there were eight.
EVTOPTA34606;I don't know, I like the play better.
EVTOPTA34607;Use this throughout the country!
EVTOPTA34608;Those poor children!
EVTOPTA34700;Ahh, music!
EVTOPTA34701;A wonderful building.
EVTOPTA3500;Arrest him
EVTOPTA3501;You've all earned it!
EVTOPTA3502;He stays
EVTOPTA3503;Break up the strike
EVTOPTA35300;Encore, Encore!
EVTOPTA35301;Encore, Encore!
EVTOPTA35400;A true masterpiece!
EVTOPTA35700;Labor merits value as much as wealth.
EVTOPTA3600;It was probably his own fault
EVTOPTA3601;Okay.
EVTOPTA3602;Let them have their little fun.
EVTOPTA3603;Why does this concern me?
EVTOPTA3604;We could use some better... channels of information.
EVTOPTA3605;Who do they think they are?
EVTOPTA3606;But that's not free, now is it?
EVTOPTA3607;We have been blessed
EVTOPTA36200;Long live the King!
EVTOPTA36201;Dangerous Ideas Afloat!
EVTOPTA36202;Lock them up!
EVTOPTA36203;Pay him off and let's be done with him
EVTOPTA36204;Free the slaves
EVTOPTA36205;Strengthen the defenses of Copenhagen.
EVTOPTA36206;That's not good!
EVTOPTA36207;Damn!
EVTOPTA36208;Damn!
EVTOPTA36209;A Sell!
EVTOPTA36210;Great stories!

EVTOPTA36213;Splendid! Art for the people!
EVTOPTA36214;Are you trying to shoot me?
EVTOPTA36215;Mmmm...beer!

EVTOPTA36217;Thought provoking indeed.
EVTOPTA36218;Fun For Everyone
EVTOPTA36219;Splendid!
EVTOPTA36220;Increased political awareness and a boost to a Liberal party
EVTOPTA36221;Send an offer
EVTOPTA36222;Damn!
EVTOPTA36230;Okay!
EVTOPTA36231;Great!
EVTOPTA36232;Oh no!
EVTOPTA36400;Such upsetting images...
EVTOPTA36401;The people's language for the nation
EVTOPTA36402;Damn authors!
EVTOPTA36403;A platform to defend our interests.
EVTOPTA36405;Dangerous ideas spreading.
EVTOPTA36600;An artistic genius
EVTOPTA36601;Education for the masses!
EVTOPTA36602;Speak free!
EVTOPTA36603;Call out the troops!
EVTOPTA36604;Our scientists help advance the nation
EVTOPTA36606;Tragedy!
EVTOPTA36607;Terrible!
EVTOPTA36608;Let's celebrate!
EVTOPTA36609;Sell that barren rock NOW!
EVTOPTA36610;Law and order please!
EVTOPTA36611;Intriguing!
EVTOPTA36612;Yes, our defense must be strong!
EVTOPTA36614;Great stuff!
EVTOPTA36615;These are hard times indeed.
EVTOPTA36616;Yes, accept the reform.

EVTOPTA36622;The peoples of Scandinavia must stand together!
EVTOPTA36700;Hail the Lion!
EVTOPTA36701;New ideas are afoot!

EVTOPTA36705;Brilliant work
EVTOPTA36706;A true humanitarian
EVTOPTA36898;Victoria Regina!
EVTOPTA36900;Reforms? Not sure we want those!
EVTOPTA36901;A touching story
EVTOPTA36902;I could use a vacation too!
EVTOPTA36903;A glorious couple!
EVTOPTA36904;We'll keep an eye on them!
EVTOPTA36905;It's fun to be in it!
EVTOPTA36906;I'm afraid we cannot help them!
EVTOPTA36907;A scandal!
EVTOPTA36908;This will speed up communications!
EVTOPTA36909;Glorious!
EVTOPTA36910;Brilliant work
EVTOPTA36911;Courage equal to desire
EVTOPTA36912;Is the shipwreck then a harvest, does tempest carry grain for thee?
EVTOPTA36913;Another prestigious sporting event.
EVTOPTA36914;Hurrah!
EVTOPTA36915;Three cheers for the Queen!
EVTOPTA36916;Repeal the Corn Laws
EVTOPTA36917;To the peak!
EVTOPTA36918;GOOOOOOAL!!!!
EVTOPTA36919;Let's get healthy!
EVTOPTA36920;Deny the Chartist Petition
EVTOPTA36921;The unions look to Labour
EVTOPTA36922;Horrible!
EVTOPTA36923;Man developing from apes? Ridiculous!
EVTOPTA36924;I say, anyone for Tennis?
EVTOPTA36925;Repress these depraved criminals!
EVTOPTA36926;Bravo!
EVTOPTA36927;Through the looking glass we go..
EVTOPTA36928;Amazing!
EVTOPTA36929;A tragedy!
EVTOPTA36930;Hurrah for the Taiping
EVTOPTA36931;Ahh, how comfortable!
EVTOPTA36932;An incredible composer
EVTOPTA36933;Is so much sports healthy?
EVTOPTA36934;An idea long since due
EVTOPTA36938;The Indian people have a voice!
EVTOPTA36939;Our mission in India requires reforms!
EVTOPTA36940;Hooray!
EVTOPTA36941;We must catch this chief in the act.
EVTOPTA36942;Get off the grass! I'm in.
EVTOPTA3700;We should consider legislation to end this
EVTOPTA3701;Tick-tock, little puppets.
EVTOPTA3702;Get rid of these silly legislations!
EVTOPTA3703;A correct observation!
EVTOPTA37200;Demand the Swiss extradite him!
EVTOPTA37201;Wonderful!
EVTOPTA37202;Let us remember the dead!
EVTOPTA37203;Send the troops!
EVTOPTA37204;Un grand homme!

EVTOPTA37217;J'accuse!
EVTOPTA37218;The affair is closed
EVTOPTA37219;C'est terrible!
EVTOPTA37220;A Miracle?
EVTOPTA37221;An artistic genius
EVTOPTA37222;Amazing!
EVTOPTA37225;Let me have just one more peek...
EVTOPTA37226;This is quite a blow!
EVTOPTA3750;They were probably conspiring
EVTOPTA3751;The law must be enforced
EVTOPTA3752;Excellent initiative!
EVTOPTA3753;The direct consequences of allowing people to assemble
EVTOPTA3754;Liberty must always be defended
EVTOPTA3755;There were legitimate grievances
EVTOPTA3756;The government wants to achieve reform
EVTOPTA37700;Don't touch the Holy Church!
EVTOPTA37701;Cuba remains Spanish!
EVTOPTA37702;We must restore order in Cuba!
EVTOPTA37703;Let's make an offer.
EVTOPTA37704;No, Cuba will forever be our Pearl of the Antilles
EVTOPTA37705;No commission is warranted
EVTOPTA37706;Hmmm...interesting.
EVTOPTA37707;Desamortise because we need cash.
EVTOPTA37708;Create the Civil Guard
EVTOPTA3800;Build local support for reform.
EVTOPTA3801;Bloody reactionaries!
EVTOPTA3802;We need to abolish some of these reforms
EVTOPTA3803;They are right as always.
EVTOPTA38500;Greetings!
EVTOPTA38501;Accept the division
EVTOPTA38503;Accept their independence
EVTOPTA3900;Allow people to legally disturb the peace? Of course not
EVTOPTA3901;Membership should be made mandatory
EVTOPTA3902;Shut them down
EVTOPTA3903;Bust the unions!
EVTOPTA4000;...so?
EVTOPTA4001;Liberty shall not perish!
EVTOPTA4100;Riff-raff!
EVTOPTA4101;This is all nonsense
EVTOPTA4102;Why is this on my table?
EVTOPTA4103;Things have never been better
EVTOPTA4200;We should push for reform
EVTOPTA4201;We should capitalize on this
EVTOPTA4202;First past the post
EVTOPTA4300;Support Charter Reform
EVTOPTA4301;Fix the indexes
EVTOPTA4302;Adjust the rules
EVTOPTA4303;Leave this to die
EVTOPTA4304;We shall see what we can do
EVTOPTA4305;Rejoice!
EVTOPTA43800;Hooray for Sturt!
EVTOPTA43801;A tragedy!
EVTOPTA43802;And isn't it a beaut!
EVTOPTA43803;Good onya, Patterson!
EVTOPTA4400;Our merchants are our pride
EVTOPTA44000;Appoint him to oversee the Molokai colony
EVTOPTA4401;Reshuffle the Cabinet
EVTOPTA4402;Inform on the merchant
EVTOPTA4403;Support the business
EVTOPTA4404;Reform the administration
EVTOPTA4405;Someone has to pay
EVTOPTA4406;Fan the flames of public opinion
EVTOPTA4407;Our people are weary
EVTOPTA4408;Surely people will see his point
EVTOPTA4409;Further the cause!
EVTOPTA4410;Black-guard reactionaries!
EVTOPTA44100;Well then I'll go to Hell!
EVTOPTA44101;Amazing!
EVTOPTA44102;You shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold
EVTOPTA44103;It is right and proper to return it.
EVTOPTA44104;You can never be too educated.
EVTOPTA44105;There are more things in the heavens and the earth...
EVTOPTA44106;Speech is a kind of act.
EVTOPTA44107;The law is the will of he whom the sheriff will obey.
EVTOPTA44108;I must have them!
EVTOPTA44109;Sea power is the arbiter of victory.
EVTOPTA4411;These policies must end
EVTOPTA44110;To attack one's country while the sword is in her hand is treason
EVTOPTA44111;We never sleep
EVTOPTA44112;Play ball!
EVTOPTA44113;Where is your cow, Mrs O'Leary?
EVTOPTA44114;Peacemaker!
EVTOPTA44115;This could become the nation's favorite pastime!
EVTOPTA44116;The spirit seizes the imagination.
EVTOPTA44117;Faith and reason can be reconciled to improve humanity.
EVTOPTA44118;For the betterment of society.
EVTOPTA44119;An extraordinary man.
EVTOPTA4412;We shall overcome!
EVTOPTA44120;Wickedness must be stamped out.
EVTOPTA44121;God our Father, Christ our Redeemer, Man our Brother
EVTOPTA4413;Spread the word!
EVTOPTA4414;Support the lobby
EVTOPTA4415;The policies will stand
EVTOPTA4416;Support the Free Traders
EVTOPTA4417;Rest, brave soldiers!
EVTOPTA4418;Tyranny is not the answer
EVTOPTA4419;Insist that there is no problem
EVTOPTA4420;We need to build more support for a war
EVTOPTA4421;Political reforms are not on the government's agenda at this point
EVTOPTA4422;Outlaw socialist unions
EVTOPTA4423;Blame the bureaucrats
EVTOPTA4424;If it still moves, regulate it
EVTOPTA4425;It seems that we have allowed our subjects too much freedom
EVTOPTA44300;Macdonald must resign!
EVTOPTA44301;Listen to the Metis demands
EVTOPTA44302;The Metis are up in arms
EVTOPTA44800;Diaz vows to remain President.
EVTOPTA44801;Viva la revolucion!

EVTOPTA45001;We have commercial interests to protect.
EVTOPTA45002;The Caribbean is our Destiny
EVTOPTA45005;It's a natural part of France!

EVTOPTA45101;Vive l'Empereur Faustin!
EVTOPTA46300;Dangerous Ideas Afloat!
EVTOPTA46301;The power of sport
EVTOPTA46302;Target practice! 
EVTOPTA46400;A time for reform has come.
EVTOPTA46600;His Ideas Have Merit
EVTOPTA46601;Dangerous Ideas Afloat!

EVTOPTA60020;I love democracy
EVTOPTA60030;Ave!
EVTOPTA60040;Long live the King!
EVTOPTA60050;Liberty!
EVTOPTA60060;It is only right and good
EVTOPTA60070;Long Live The King!
EVTOPTA60080;Muahahaha!
EVTOPTA60120;Let's do it
EVTOPTA60130;Let's do it
EVTOPTA60140;Otherwise people would exploit the situation
EVTOPTA60150;Get back in the kitchen!
EVTOPTA70000;Extend Slavery
EVTOPTA70001;Excellent!
EVTOPTA90000;They're coming right for us!
EVTOPTA90001;What are you talking about?
EVTOPTA90002;We will save them!
EVTOPTA90003;Fools!
EVTOPTA90004;We're here to help you.
EVTOPTA90005;Good call.
EVTOPTA90006;Good call.
EVTOPTA90007;Good call.
EVTOPTA90008;Good call.
EVTOPTA90009;Good call.
EVTOPTA90040;This could mean trouble.
EVTOPTA90100;Perhaps we can work something out
EVTOPTA90101;How depressing
EVTOPTA90103;I hate crowds
EVTOPTA90105;Better dead than red!
EVTOPTA90900;We are united again
EVTOPTA90901;We are united again
EVTOPTA90902;Freedom!
EVTOPTA90910;Wagons West!
EVTOPTA90950;This shall not stand! 
EVTOPTB100;An excellent initiative!
EVTOPTB10100;Spare no effort in relieving the local farmers.
EVTOPTB10105;Let them have their say in parliament, and the effects might dissipate
EVTOPTB10110;The old order must be defended!
EVTOPTB10120;Censor the paper
EVTOPTB10130;Suppress the society
EVTOPTB10140;Pass a local ordnance against it
EVTOPTB10150;Hint at policy changes
EVTOPTB10160;Leave them be
EVTOPTB10200;Negotiate with the leaders
EVTOPTB10230;How bad could it get?
EVTOPTB10250;Accuse them of opportunism
EVTOPTB10270;Couldn't the principal do something about this nonsense?
EVTOPTB10280;It is good to see the classics receiving some attention. Socratic Dialogues, anyone?
EVTOPTB10290;Such a voice must be heard in all of $COUNTRY$!
EVTOPTB10300;I refuse to submit to political demands by the entrenched elites
EVTOPTB10320;Certainly, this is only propaganda designed to exploit the working classes.
EVTOPTB10330;Let the boys in blue have their way with these fermenters of revolution
EVTOPTB110;Pressure the local government to stop it
EVTOPTB11100;I will not accept a crown from the gutter.
EVTOPTB11101;We will not have our ancestral rights infringed!
EVTOPTB111011928;Never!
EVTOPTB11103;Who is this man, and what does he want from me?
EVTOPTB12000;The labourers are careless!
EVTOPTB12010;Oppose reform on grounds of principle.
EVTOPTB12030;Suggest they work overtime
EVTOPTB12040;We should consider some local restrictions.
EVTOPTB12050;Blame local farmers
EVTOPTB12060;Relieve civilian sufferings
EVTOPTB12070;Distribute the food among the poor
EVTOPTB12080;Sadly, there is little to be done
EVTOPTB12090;Reimburse locals for their losses
EVTOPTB12100;Better living through chemistry!
EVTOPTB12110;Send some to our neighbors!
EVTOPTB12120;Some things should be forgotten
EVTOPTB12140;Establish a Naval School
EVTOPTB12150;Work overtime to replace the boilers
EVTOPTB12160;Profit!
EVTOPTB12170;We shall all dye sooner or later.
EVTOPTB12180;Naturally the government will seek to aid
EVTOPTB12190;Turn down the offer
EVTOPTB12200;Our workers must be kept safe and sound
EVTOPTB12210;Help feed the local poor
EVTOPTB12220;Let the farmers keep some
EVTOPTB12230;Give them the radios
EVTOPTB12240;Sadly we cannot make any guarantees.
EVTOPTB12250;We make no distinctions of class.
EVTOPTB12260;No wasteful fiscal policies on my watch
EVTOPTB12270;Insist that government officials wear them
EVTOPTB12280;Give them to the poor and replace them
EVTOPTB130;We can not act at this time
EVTOPTB13000;Expel the barbarians!
EVTOPTB13010;Go home!
EVTOPTB13015;We must respect and tolerate the differences between our respective cultures
EVTOPTB13020;Force them to stay
EVTOPTB13030;Shut it down!
EVTOPTB13040;Hmm. No.
EVTOPTB13050;Issue an edict banning the sale of opium
EVTOPTB13060;Order local officials to destroy opium shipments
EVTOPTB13065;No! Apologize and stop this nonsense!
EVTOPTB13080;Perhaps some gold could make things better?
EVTOPTB13110;Is that a draft? Close the door!
EVTOPTB13120;Dangerous or not, I believe she is right
EVTOPTB13130;I think we can manage without it
EVTOPTB13160;Execute him
EVTOPTB13170;Drink the bitter chalice
EVTOPTB13190;We will not abandon our traditional ways
EVTOPTB13200;Liberty or Death!
EVTOPTB13201;Perhaps we should let the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Dragon sleep.
EVTOPTB13210;The old ways endure
EVTOPTB13220;Why? They have nothing to offer us?
EVTOPTB13230;Apologize, but leave it at that
EVTOPTB13240;Let it through
EVTOPTB13250;We have more important matters to attend to
EVTOPTB13260;You do your worst, and we shall do our best
EVTOPTB13290;Minor reform.
EVTOPTB13300;Ignore it
EVTOPTB140;People should be free to drink
EVTOPTB14000;Some protective measures are in order to safe-guard our industry
EVTOPTB14010;Decisive arguments for Interventionism
EVTOPTB14020;Religion is not a political issue!
EVTOPTB14030;We need to limit their citizenship.
EVTOPTB14040;We need to maintain constant vigilance in foreign affairs
EVTOPTB14050;Lower the tariffs on those goods and raise it on some others.
EVTOPTB14060;Essentially, free trade is to be preferred
EVTOPTB14070;You both have great arguments, but we will not monopolize that.
EVTOPTB14080;You have nothing to worry about.
EVTOPTB14090;It takes some time, but it will work.
EVTOPTB14100;The economic planners knows what they are doing.
EVTOPTB14110;Charity is good, but no.
EVTOPTB14120;Secularization ensures state neutrality in issues of morality
EVTOPTB14130;We can do nothing.
EVTOPTB14140;Some funds could be considered on grounds of cultural importance
EVTOPTB14150;Why should they have the same rights?.
EVTOPTB14160;Limited citizenship, but with certain exceptions
EVTOPTB14170;Full citizenship, with only minor qualifications, is the way forward
EVTOPTB14180;We do need a strong military.
EVTOPTB14190;They need better food in order to fight well.
EVTOPTB14200;Can't they fight without them?
EVTOPTB14210;Violence is never the answer.
EVTOPTB14500;The rain will fall, sooner or later.
EVTOPTB14510;A liberal upper house ensures free trade
EVTOPTB14520;Brutally force people off their land? Not a very $COUNTRY_ADJ$ thing to do!
EVTOPTB14530;Very concerning... but oh, my, it's almost teatime. Cricket later, anyone?
EVTOPTB14540;Let us see these creatures in their natural habitat instead.
EVTOPTB14550;Long live the captains of industry and technology!
EVTOPTB14560;I believe the resources could be better spent elsewhere
EVTOPTB14570;We must seek to negotiate an equitable settlement
EVTOPTB14580;Their beliefs must be respected
EVTOPTB14590;We must shoulder the responsibility
EVTOPTB14600;We shall make whatever concessions necessary to preserve the calm
EVTOPTB14620;Intervene... eventually...
EVTOPTB14630;Reincorporate the colony and take steps to prevent this in the future
EVTOPTB14640;What? Me worry?
EVTOPTB14650;Hunting is just a part of the circle of life
EVTOPTB14660;Let us invite that ambassador... what was his name?
EVTOPTB14670;We accept full responsibility for the wrongs committed.
EVTOPTB14680;I believe we must focus on the homefront first
EVTOPTB14690;A fantastic idea that we should spare no effort in implementing
EVTOPTB14710;The customer is always rig... I mean... the government shall duly consider this
EVTOPTB14720;We must undertake a national campaign in favor of them
EVTOPTB14730;Ignore the League
EVTOPTB14750;Liberal arguments prevail
EVTOPTB14760;The office is in the pocket of Big Industry, and Big Industry is to blame!
EVTOPTB14780;Naturally we must aid the colony, and help strive for its betterment
EVTOPTB14790;Cover up the report, lest the capitalists get uppity!
EVTOPTB14800;This will teach future generations about the common heritage of mankind
EVTOPTB14810;I suppose we could drop by the Chamber of Commerce and have a chat with the boys...
EVTOPTB150;The temperance movement should bide its time
EVTOPTB15000;Conduct a thorough investigation of the matter
EVTOPTB15010;Rescind the policy
EVTOPTB15020;Strychnine or cyanide?
EVTOPTB15030;Keep them ignorant
EVTOPTB15040;Get rid of the worst troublemakers
EVTOPTB15050;Shut it down before it gets worse
EVTOPTB15060;Shut it down, but allow farmers to keep their money.
EVTOPTB15070;Carry a big stick
EVTOPTB15080;Disperse them
EVTOPTB15090;Reprimand the officer
EVTOPTB15100;Crush the revolters!
EVTOPTB15110;Do not curtail the distribution
EVTOPTB15130;Use $PROVINCECULTURE$
EVTOPTB15140;Favor the capitalists
EVTOPTB15150;Bide our time
EVTOPTB15160;Take steps to replace the stolen weapons
EVTOPTB15170;Conduct a real investigation
EVTOPTB15180;Let it run its own course
EVTOPTB15190;Intervene eventually
EVTOPTB15200;Pretend that it rains
EVTOPTB15210;This man is clearly dangerous. Execute him
EVTOPTB15220;Demand the strictest discipline
EVTOPTB15230;Ignore the issue
EVTOPTB15240;Shut it down
EVTOPTB15250;Leave the issue be
EVTOPTB15260;No, let them build and own houses
EVTOPTB15270;He's just one man
EVTOPTB15274;He's still just one man
EVTOPTB15280;Never mind
EVTOPTB15290;Verb forms, sweetie. They are the keys to success.
EVTOPTB15300;Well, why not?
EVTOPTB15310;Spare no effort in shutting it down.
EVTOPTB160;Force a repeal of the act!
EVTOPTB16000;Advance the flag of Dixie! Hurrah!
EVTOPTB160001;Out with the Manchu!
EVTOPTB16030;To southern labour!
EVTOPTB16040;... and slave
EVTOPTB16050;Plebian songs
EVTOPTB160502;Do not waste my time with this nonsense!
EVTOPTB16060;Plebian songs
EVTOPTB16070;Never were truer words spoken!
EVTOPTB16080;Dangerous ideas
EVTOPTB16090;Suppress the society
EVTOPTB16100;Suppress the society
EVTOPTB16110;Repulsive!
EVTOPTB16120;Aye!
EVTOPTB16130;He stays in $STATENAME$
EVTOPTB16140;Shut it down
EVTOPTB16150;Debate them at every opportunity
EVTOPTB16180;Enact an ordinance to stop them
EVTOPTB16190;Enact an ordinance to stop them
EVTOPTB16400;Now is not the time
EVTOPTB170;Socialists must be opposed at every turn
EVTOPTB17000;If only there were popular support for this idea...
EVTOPTB17010;Applaud the Parliament, and express support for its cause
EVTOPTB17020;This blatant allowing of women to talk in public assemblies is silly to the point of the absurd
EVTOPTB17030;BLOOD AND CONQUEST!!! ... Apologies, what were you saying?
EVTOPTB17040;This man clearly has no future in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army.
EVTOPTB17050;We must express our cordial understanding of, and support for, these sentiments
EVTOPTB17060;Maybe if they listened more to what these nice ladies are trying to explain to them?
EVTOPTB17070;Aaaah, the reactionary cause breathes morning air
EVTOPTB17080;This campaign for basic human rights needs to go national
EVTOPTB17090;Isn't there at least one MP living thereabouts?
EVTOPTB17100;So our erudites are intimidated by the female intellect?
EVTOPTB17110;Denounce the book
EVTOPTB17120;I predict that the cause will gain a fair amount of traction among the populace
EVTOPTB17140;Release her and let us be done with this affair
EVTOPTB17150;Ignore the matter
EVTOPTB17160;Let us hush up this blot of shame on our national pride, before someone catches wind
EVTOPTB17170;At least we're better than the people over in...
EVTOPTB17500;I suppose we have a few units that we could spare for the good cause...
EVTOPTB17510;Anything to stave off the red hydra!
EVTOPTB17520;Denounce the profiteering of those fat-cats
EVTOPTB17530;But.. the plight of the workers? Exploitation by the ruling classes?
EVTOPTB17540;Curtail local press distribution for any papers suspected of collaboration
EVTOPTB17550;What is this... horrid piece of paper... a Fish & Chips wrapping?
EVTOPTB17560;Naturally we support this fine display of international solidarity between workers
EVTOPTB17570;Interesting, I am sure
EVTOPTB17580;They must stop infringing on organizational freedoms
EVTOPTB17590;Hey! That's unconstitutional!
EVTOPTB17600;Let us see if we cannot defuse some of this enthusiasm into more palatable forms
EVTOPTB17610;Leave them be, and hope that they don't gain too much ground
EVTOPTB17620;This is just a ruse to build support for the party, end this nonsense!
EVTOPTB17630;Neat black flags they have! I have a white one!
EVTOPTB17640;Prevent the organization from recruiting on barracks grounds
EVTOPTB17650;I believe we will see it primarily read by the middle class
EVTOPTB17660;Issue a national apology to the liberal party for the state's failure in protecting them
EVTOPTB17670;Express tacit support for the campaign
EVTOPTB17680;Outlaw paramilitary organizations
EVTOPTB17690;Send in military troops to squash the rebellion
EVTOPTB17700;Leave them be
EVTOPTB180;Stop the shipment
EVTOPTB18000;Exert political pressure
EVTOPTB18010;Conservative-Liberal
EVTOPTB18020;It might be the time for reform
EVTOPTB18030;Ignore it
EVTOPTB18040;Yes, they need to be contained
EVTOPTB18050;Motion dismissed
EVTOPTB1806;My feelings precisely!
EVTOPTB18070;Question the legality of the motion
EVTOPTB18080;Reign them in
EVTOPTB18090;Filibuster any motion for reform
EVTOPTB18100;Force through the reform
EVTOPTB18110;Now is not the time
EVTOPTB18120;Crack goes the whip!
EVTOPTB18130;Move to stop the defections
EVTOPTB18140;Prevent the power grab
EVTOPTB18150;Let them do as they please.
EVTOPTB18160;We have done nothing wrong
EVTOPTB18170;Unruly miscreant
EVTOPTB18180;Brilliant!
EVTOPTB18190;We have enough
EVTOPTB18200;Ignore him
EVTOPTB18500;Use the propaganda
EVTOPTB18510;Unmatched Glory
EVTOPTB18520;We are in it to win it
EVTOPTB18530;Other nations sing our praise!
EVTOPTB18540;Modesty and Restraint
EVTOPTB18550;Liberty shall not perish
EVTOPTB18560;Let us forgive
EVTOPTB18570;Further the cause of science
EVTOPTB18580;It might be a while longer
EVTOPTB190;Drinking is, by definition, irresponsible
EVTOPTB19005;Fall back
EVTOPTB19010;Our isolation is splendid!
EVTOPTB19020;We have better things to do
EVTOPTB19022;The province belongs to $FROMCOUNTRY$
EVTOPTB19023;The cause of science demands it
EVTOPTB19024;The governments policy stands
EVTOPTB19025;Let's see if they can find any edible plants
EVTOPTB19030;We have other concerns
EVTOPTB19031;Nevermind, then!
EVTOPTB19040;The Valley is Ours
EVTOPTB19043;Pressure the government
EVTOPTB2000;An excellent opportunity to promote local harmony!
EVTOPTB20000;This doesn't concern us
EVTOPTB2010;Encourage local business to employ
EVTOPTB20100;Maybe we should talk about this...
EVTOPTB20102;Don't listen to him!
EVTOPTB20103;Fire the fool!
EVTOPTB20104;We are open to discussion.
EVTOPTB20105;Let's not fight over this.
EVTOPTB2020;A clear sign that immigration must be curtailed
EVTOPTB2030;I will keep Aniya Yezierska'
EVTOPTB2040;No need to hurry.
EVTOPTB2050;Bloody nonsense this!
EVTOPTB2060;Let us listen to their grievances
EVTOPTB2080;We shall certainly investigate the situation
EVTOPTB2090;Seems that the locals have the right ideas there!
EVTOPTB21010;Sorry, I gave at the office.
EVTOPTB21020;Quarantine the affected state
EVTOPTB21030;Not really, why?
EVTOPTB21040;Weak and unable to resist, you say?
EVTOPTB2110;... why do people tell me these things?!
EVTOPTB2120;Which is precisely what will happen!
EVTOPTB2130;Pizza!
EVTOPTB22000;This all sounds rather dreary...?
EVTOPTB22010;I think there are more humane solutions to consider
EVTOPTB22020;Certain reforms are arguably in order
EVTOPTB22030;Let us not throw allegations wildly about.
EVTOPTB22040;Excellent! Next order of business!
EVTOPTB22050;Search Low!
EVTOPTB22060;I say we stick with the old ways
EVTOPTB22070;I am not convinced. People need to learn lessons in life
EVTOPTB22080;I do not have time for the foppish drivel of bleeding-heart liberals!
EVTOPTB22500;Balanced government budget, deregulation and sound money.
EVTOPTB22520;As long as they are happy, I have no objections.
EVTOPTB22530;I think that the government that governs the least governs the best
EVTOPTB22550;We must not let the whims of profiteers dictate the national economic policy
EVTOPTB22560;We should leverage this affluence
EVTOPTB22570;We will not spend government money in support of a private company
EVTOPTB22580;The freedom of trade shall not be abridged in any way.
EVTOPTB23200;We must consider this proposition.
EVTOPTB23201;That's enough of this nonsense.
EVTOPTB23212;Keep looking at the sky!
EVTOPTB2510;The explosion was an accident, and we cannot allow the mob to dictate foreign policy
EVTOPTB2520;Send an official letter thanking them for their time, and end the negotiations
EVTOPTB2530;I do not believe that this is really worth going to war over, truth to be told
EVTOPTB3000;Seek local support for reform.
EVTOPTB30000;Our resources would be better used for other purposes.
EVTOPTB3001;Seek acceptable compromises
EVTOPTB3003;Back local Liberals
EVTOPTB3004;This situation is completely unacceptable.
EVTOPTB3005;Ignore the report to please conservatives
EVTOPTB3006;Force it through
EVTOPTB3100;...it's just the truth?
EVTOPTB3101;I guess we caught him with his pants down
EVTOPTB3102;Deny the rumors
EVTOPTB31311;We do not, at this time, feel inclined to sign this document
EVTOPTB3200;Let it operate
EVTOPTB3201;Make him disappear
EVTOPTB3202;Let's be sportsmanlike
EVTOPTB3203;THEY'RE AFTER ME!!!
EVTOPTB3204;The liberals won, fair and square
EVTOPTB32509;No, I don't think so. Maybe we could build a bridge there someday?
EVTOPTB3300;Seek local support for reform
EVTOPTB33004;The Danes of Schleswig are not a threat
EVTOPTB33005;It is not our problem.
EVTOPTB3301;Argue against a pension raise
EVTOPTB3302;I believe we must bide our time
EVTOPTB3303;I guess we could use some reforms
EVTOPTB3304;We are in no hurry
EVTOPTB3305;I concur with the honorable gentlemen
EVTOPTB3306;No promises at this junction
EVTOPTB3307;We have an ambitious reform in mind!
EVTOPTB3400;They're called poor people for a reason
EVTOPTB3401;The present unemployment subsidies work well.
EVTOPTB3402;Reduce the unemployment benefits
EVTOPTB3403;What do they want? Better wages? Fine.
EVTOPTB3404;Ignore them
EVTOPTB34607;It's immoral!
EVTOPTB3500;Leave him be
EVTOPTB3501;Get back to work!
EVTOPTB3502;He goes
EVTOPTB3503;Let them strike.
EVTOPTB3600;They clearly need safety instructions
EVTOPTB3601;Good for him.
EVTOPTB3602;So?
EVTOPTB3603;I agree with the employers.
EVTOPTB3604;Violate their personal integrities? Doubtful.
EVTOPTB3605;I find the demands reasonable.
EVTOPTB3606;Our workers' health is our first priority.
EVTOPTB3607;We are an international example
EVTOPTB36202;Let them be
EVTOPTB36203;Let him be
EVTOPTB36204;Crush the rebellion
EVTOPTB36205;This is an unnecessary expense.
EVTOPTB36221;Forget about it
EVTOPTB36230;Never!
EVTOPTB36609;For the glory of Sweden, we must keep it!
EVTOPTB36612;No, not at this time
EVTOPTB36617;No, we will keep the Four Estates!
EVTOPTB36906;Let us see what we can do!
EVTOPTB36916;We cannot allow our market to be flooded by cheap imports!
EVTOPTB36920;Grant them some of what they desire
EVTOPTB36925;Let's concentrate on the problems of poverty!
EVTOPTB36934;The current system is fine
EVTOPTB36939;Don't stir up the hornet's nest.
EVTOPTB36941;What can we do to solve this situation?
EVTOPTB3700;Hard work is the foundation of a good moral character
EVTOPTB3701;If a little rest can keep them happy...
EVTOPTB3702;Try it as a local experiment
EVTOPTB3703;I'm not sure about that...
EVTOPTB37200;His ramblings in the Alps are no threat to us.
EVTOPTB37216;No! He is innocent!
EVTOPTB3750;Release the men with an official apology
EVTOPTB3751;Let the law slip
EVTOPTB3752;Shadowy cabals? In my $COUNTRY$?!
EVTOPTB3753;An unfortunate side-effect to a cherished liberty
EVTOPTB3754;Let us avoid a slip into anarchy
EVTOPTB3755;This was an unprovoked attack
EVTOPTB3756;Reforms will come when the time is right
EVTOPTB37700;We need the money!
EVTOPTB37703;We don't want it.
EVTOPTB37704;Si, Cuba can be had -- for a price.
EVTOPTB37705;Si, reforms are needed
EVTOPTB37707;The people need those lands!
EVTOPTB37708;We are satisfied with the National Militia
EVTOPTB3800;Haha... no.
EVTOPTB3801;I am sure there is a compromise to be found here somewhere
EVTOPTB3802;We need not do anything rash
EVTOPTB3803;Try it as a local experiment
EVTOPTB38502;Resist it by force!
EVTOPTB38502;We can not risk intervention by outside forces
EVTOPTB38503;Zanzibar is OURS!
EVTOPTB3900;We should build local platforms for reform
EVTOPTB3901;We need to get rid of this whole nasty business of unions
EVTOPTB3902;Let them continue to exist
EVTOPTB3903;Green-light the practices
EVTOPTB4000;Support the movement
EVTOPTB4001;Not at this time
EVTOPTB4100;All voices will be heard.

EVTOPTE14070;That is a great idea. We will do that.

However it was take further by Heidegger and later Sartre, Beauvoir, and Camus, and became focused on what give meaning to the person, where the person should be understood more like a being that is free to make action and thus create her own meaning than the old cartesian self.

experimental_carriers_desc;The first experiments at flying aircraft off of warships often consisted of a small flight deck attached to an existing warship. Once these experiments had demonstrated the viability of aircraft taking off of and landing on ships at sea, navies began to convert small hulls to launch aircraft. These experimental carriers refined the basic techniques of carrier operations and demonstrated the potential of carrier warfare, but they were too small to have a decisive impact on naval combat on their own.

fatherland_volunteers_desc;During The War of The Triple Alliance, when Paraguayan troops invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso, Pedro II, the Brazilian Emperor, angered by what he saw as incompetence on part of the Brazilian military, demanded that he himself be allowed to go in person to the front. When both the Cabinet and the National Assembly refused his wish, Pedro threatened to abdicate the imperial throne and join the army as a volunteer, reportedly saying that 'If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor, they cannot prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer'. Naturally, the Cabinet was left without much choice. Brazilians who later volunteered during the war were called 'Fatherland Volunteers', in memory of Pedro's quote. Say it like Pedro did, and the nation will follow wherever you lead.

friedrich_engels;Friedrich Engels
friedrich_engels_desc;As a young man Engels went to Manchester to help his father manage his cotton-factory. Engels was shocked by the poverty in the city and began writing an account that was published as Condition of the Working Classes in England (1844). Here Engels met Marx with whom he would write and try to organize the international worker organizations for the rest of his life. Engels lived in the shadows of Marx' intellectually, but economically he financed Marx so that he could write. Basically there wouldn't have been a Marx without an Engels and vice versa.

friedrich_hayek_desc;An Austrian economist who would challenge the influence of Keynesian economics upon the actions of the State in the 1930s and attach the planned economic models inherent in both socialist and fascist political models increasingly in vogue in the era. Much like his teacher Ludwig von Mises, Hayek attacked Keynesian economic prescriptions for dealing with economic downturns as causing more potential problems than solutions by creating conditions for inflation by raising demand more rapidly than supply could meet. Hayek rejected the idea of central planning in the marketplace as highly inefficient in its ability to produce the supply and quality of goods that would be generated by consumer demand
friedrich_list;Friedrich List
friedrich_list_desc;Friedrich List was a nationalist and romantic critic of economic theory and one of the forefathers of the German Historical School. His best-known work, The National System of Political Economy (1841) was written as against the free-trade doctrines that permeated Classical economics. However, his was not a polemical defense of protectionism. He argued it on the basis of his analysis of economics, which stressed political factors - notably, the 'nation' - in economics. List argued that it was the government's responsibility to foster the 'productive powers' of a nation and, once these were in place, then free trade could ensue, but not before. This is akin to the modern 'infant industry' argument for protection. More relevantly, he developed a theory of economic 'stages' which was to serve as a blueprint for the German Historical School.

gustav_von_schmoller;Gustav von Schmoller
gustav_von_schmoller_desc;Schmoller's opposition to Neoclassical economics entered him into a famous methodological debate (Methodenstreit) with Carl Menger. Although many argue that he lost the debate by the simple fact of non-engagement (it is reported that upon receiving Menger's Investigations, he returned it unread to its author and published a 'semi-review' of it claiming that, indeed, it had not even been worth reading), Schmoller nonetheless retained his grip on the German university appointment system and kept Classical and Neoclassical economic theory largely out of German teaching - earning him the eternal enmity of the only potential challenger at the time, Menger's Austrian School. Gustav Schmoller's political involvements were also important, in 1872, he formed the Verein fer Sozialpolitik, ('Society for Social Policy'), a group of largely conservative economists which supported a kind of corporatist state-industry-labor nexus. Liberals deplored their advocacy for state interventionism and came to label Schmoller and the Historicists as Kathedersozialisten (or 'Socialists of the Chair') - a jest they never entirely lived down.

His influence cannot be underestimated, among his disciples was the young Karl Marx who further developed this type of idealism though into a different direction.

human_resource_development;Human Resource Development
human_resource_development_desc;A theory of production management developed from the work of Elton Mayo based on research into productivity conducted at the Hawthorne Works in Chicago in the United States in the 1920s. Challenging the theories of Scientific Management, the Hawthorne Studies, and the interpretation of the data provided by Mayo, a more ehuman-centerede approach to worker management as the key to improved productivity was developed. By making workers feel they were a valued part of the production process and not simply ecogs in the machinee productivity would increase. While the analysis of the data was disputed by many researchers, the arguments gained influence as the twentieth century evolved

hyperinflation;Hyperinflation
hyperinflation_desc;For many nations, the socioeconomic strains caused by involvement in wars with other industrial nations resulted in huge deficits that made it impossible to return immediately to the gold standard. Some nations, facing new demands upon their incomes as a result of new social obligations to those involved in recent wars or obligations for being on the losing side of wars, found the demands too great, and sought to resolve their problems by expanding the amount of currency of circulation. With nothing to guarantee the value of the currency, the result would be to rapidly depreciate the value of the currency relative to other currencies or materials such as gold. The social impact of such government policies were traumatic, especially for those who lived on limited or fixed incomes or those who had investments denominated in the rapidly depreciating currency. To many, the willingness of the State to engage in such activity, and the market reaction to such activities, would lead to a search for alternative ideologies to restore order and stability in society

i_analytic_philosophy;Analytic Philosophy
i_analytic_philosophy_desc;This was originally a disparate movement of philosophers who wanted to free logics and the foundation of mathematics from elder defunct and inconsistent thesis. It later developed into trying to bridge language and formal logics and thus create a objective realist ground for reality. This took a sidepath into logical positivism. However the objectivist position crashed as one of its early proteges Ludwig Wittgenstein took a 90 degree turn and tried to refute his own earlier position.
i_empiricism;Empiricism
i_empiricism_desc;In its strong form, it is the thesis that there is no reality behind appearances. A weaker form of empiricism admits of the existence of a reality which is, however, trans-empirical. The transcendent nature of reality determines that we can have no knowledge of it and thus must simply catalog the formal relations between appearances.
i_scientific_management;Scientific Management
i_scientific_management_desc;A theory of production management developed by Frederick William Taylor in 1911 that asserted that worker productivity could be maximized by optimizing different tasks to those workers who are best able to perform those tasks. In combination with the provision of break times to workers to break the monotony of the daily work routine, Taylores theories of worker management and efitting the worker to the jobe would come to be embraced as a basic tenet to maintaining and expanding production. However, one limit to Taylorism was its emphasis of the worker as simply part of the production process and as the twentieth century evolved some commentators came to see Taylores approach to worker management as a cause of increased interest in labor unions and socialism among the working class

However, the realities of war in the industrial age and increasing economic instability of periods of expansion and contraction resulted in non-Western societies at times being unable to meet their needs for industrial goods from the traditional producers of such goods in the West. As a result, an opening for producers in non-Western societies to meet the demand for those industrial goods that could not be acquired easily from the West arose, and industrialization in the non-Western world began to grow. Eventually pressure to protect these new industries from competition from overseas would lead some nations which had maintained political independence to adopt policies of import substitution industrialization to encourage their societies to break their dependence upon the West for industrial goods and, by extension, strengthen their own societies in the global economic system. Import substitution industrialization would gain in influence during the course of the twentieth century as the resources of the West were dedicated more towards resolving problems in the West.

impressionist_art_desc;The ambition of the impressionists was depicting the world not only as it was seen and known, but also as it was felt and experienced. This ambition led them to explore and extend the boundaries of their tools and traditions. Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Frederic Bazille were among those that defined the era and made some deep impressions in the history of art.

impressionist_literature_desc;The ambition of the impressionists was depicting the world not only as it was seen and known, but also as it was felt and experienced. This ambition led them to explore and extend the boundaries of their tools and traditions. Literary impressionism was manifested through mostly symbolic poetry, describing the world in vague, sometimes momentary words. Major writers were Paul Verlaine, Stephane Mallarme, and in America T.S. Eliot and James Joyce.

impressionist_music_desc;The ambition of the impressionists was depicting the world not only as it was seen and known, but also as it was felt and experienced. This ambition led them to explore and extend the boundaries of their tools and traditions. Claude Debussy was considered the ancestor of musical impressionism, but others like Maurice Ravel, Frederick Delius and Ottorino Respighi were major players in this revolt against the romantic ideals that had dominated music for so long.

irving_fischer;Irving Fischer
irving_fischer_desc;Irving Fisher was one of the earliest American Neoclassicals of unusual mathematical sophistication. He made numerous important contributions to the Neoclassical Marginalist Revolution. This Yale economist was an eccentric and colorful figure. When Irving Fisher wrote his 1892 dissertation, he constructed a remarkable machine equipped with pumps, wheels, levers and pipes in order to illustrate his price theory. Socially, he was an avid advocate of eugenics and health food diets. He made a fortune with his visible index card system - known today as the rolodex - and advocated the establishment of an 100 percent reserve requirement banking system. His fortune was lost and his reputation was severely marred by the 1929 Wall Street Crash, when just days before the crash, he was reassuring investors that stock prices were not overinflated but, rather, had achieved a new, permanent plateau.

jazz;Jazz
jazz_desc;Originating in the fusion of Western musical tradition with elements of traditional African music, Jazz evolved out of the nightclubs of New Orleans in the southern United States in the early twentieth century. Its blend of frenetic, intoxicating rhythms, powerful melodies which encouraged improvisation by performers to add their own distinctive touches to each performance, and energetic vocals would hit upon the world just as new technologies to spread new music, such as the phonograph record, radio and sound cinema, provided a platform to showcase it to a worldwide audience. In the 1920s it became one of the dominant forms of popular music in the world, though many of the traditional arbiters of taste frowned upon its popularity as further proof that society was rebelling against proper authority
jean_jaures;Jean Jaures
jean_jaures_desc;Jaures was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1885. Defeated in the 1889 elections he returned to the University of Toulouse. He became increasingly radical in his political views and after reading Karl Marx he began advocating socialism. He was not a revolutionary and supported the Independent Socialists. While out of parliament Jaures completed his mammoth Socialist History of the French Revolution. He also joined with Aristide Briand and Rene Viviani in 1904 to establish the left-wing newspaper, L'Humanite in 1904. A new Socialist Party under Jaures grew rapidly at the beginning of the century but split over the correct response to German militarism. Jaures advocated a policy of international arbitration whereas others supported the Triple Entente.

johann_heinrich_von_thenen;Johann Heinrich von Thenen
johann_heinrich_von_thenen_desc;Johann Heinrich von Thenen was a North German landowner from the Mecklenburg area. Although educated at Gettingen, he spent most of his life managing his rural estate, Tellow.  In the first volume of his treatise, The Isolated State (1826), he laid down the first serious treatment of spatial economics, connecting with the theory of rent.  His second volume (1850) developed the essence of the marginal productivity theory of distribution in a mathematically precise way, thereby making one of the most important Proto-Marginalists of the era. Nearing his death, he asked that his famous equation for the marginal product of labor, or natural wage, be carved into his tombstone.
john_elliot_cairnes;John Elliot Cairnes
john_elliot_cairnes_desc;John Elliot Cairnes was a follower of John Stuart Mill. His Slave Power (1862), a defense of the North in the American Civil War, made a great impression in England. He has written about noncompeting groups in the labor market and is known for his distrust of mathematical economics. Among his works are The Character and Logical Method of Political Economy (1857) and Some Leading Principles of Political Economy Newly Expounded (1874). 
john_maynard_keynes;John Maynard Keynes
john_maynard_keynes_desc;An English economist who challenged the orthodox view of the role of the State in the management of economic forces in society and the relationship between supply and demand in times of economic crisis. Drawing upon the abilities of states to mobilize their economies during wars with other industrial nations, Keynes maintained that the State could use its influence to promote more efficient economic development. But his most radical theory involved the role of aggregate demand in the economy, arguing that it was demand, not supply, that was the final determinant in the levels of output and growth that an economy could produce, and that in times of economic slowdown or crisis, the solution to the crisis involved revival of demand to absorb excess supply and create the conditions for a revival of production to meet further increases in demand. While his theories had many critics, they became highly influential as the twentieth century progressed
john_ramsay_mcculloch;John Ramsay McCulloch
john_ramsay_mcculloch_desc;A prolific Scottish journalist, John Ramsay McCulloch was one of the most ardent and doctrinaire expositors of the Classical Ricardian School. McCulloch began his career as the editor of The Scotsman, eventually moving on to the whiggish Edinburgh Review, where he served as economics editor until the late 1830s. McCulloch used his position at the Review to popularize the Classical theories and promote his favorite economic policies, such as the repeal of the Corn Laws, the retention of the Poor Laws and the legalization of trade unions. McCulloch also lectured on political economy at University College London from 1828 to 1832. In 1838, he was appointed the Comptroller of HM Stationary Office. McCulloch's main work, Principles (1825), was perhaps the first successful 'serious' textbook in economics (and a rather loyal reading of Ricardo's theory). However, McCulloch is often considered a 'lightweight' in terms of the development of economic theory. His main contribution was the ill-fated 'wages fund' doctrine (1824, 1825, 1826). McCulloch was also the editor of the 1828 edition of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations and the 1846 edition of David Ricardo's Works. He also composed some of the earliest accounts of the history of economic thought (naturally, flattering to the Ricardians).  His monumental 1837 treatise provides a statistical account of the failure of the Malthusian population doctrine.
john_stuart_mill;John Stuart Mill
john_stuart_mill_desc;John Stuart Mill was the son of James Mill, the famous utilitarian, he quickly became known as one of the more brilliant minds of the United Kingdom, and also one of the more radical. He published several books among them A System of Logic (1843), Principles of Political Economy (1848), On Liberty (1859), Considerations on Representative Government (1861) and Utilitarianism (1861), all of which made him the centre-figure of social liberalism and a more humane view of society.

joseph_schumpeter;Joseph Schumpeter
joseph_schumpeter_desc;After a quick doctorate at Vienna, Schumpeter roamed about as something of a footloose lawyer until he rejoined academia in 1909. It was while he was teaching at Czernowitz (now in the Ukraine) that he wrote his Theory of Economic Development (1911), where he first outlined his famous theory of entrepreneurship. He argued those daring spirits, entrepreneurs, created technical and financial innovations in the face of competition and falling profits - and that it was these spurts of activity which generated (irregular) economic growth. In 1919, Schumpeter became the Austrian Minister of Finance - unfortunately, presiding over the hyperinflation of the period, and thus was dismissed later that year. Although excelling as a teacher above everything, Joseph Schumpeter nonetheless completed three more books while at Harvard: his didactic Business Cycles (1939), his popular Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942) - in which he famously predicted the downfall of capitalism in the hands of intellectuals.

karl_knies_desc;Knies's linear stages argument spoke of 'moral progress' which would render most theories obsolete. His 1873 work, however, contained little of the historical method in it.

karl_marx;Karl Marx
karl_marx_desc;Karl Marx was originally disciple of Hegel, but evolved his idealistic philosophy. Later in Paris he began mixing with members of the working class for the first time. Marx was shocked by their poverty but impressed by their sense of comradeship. In an article that he wrote for the Franco-German Annals, Marx applied Hegel's dialectic theory to what he had observed in Paris. Marx, who now described himself as a communist, argued that the working class (the proletariat), would eventually be the emancipators of society. Marx' most influential works were, The German Ideology, The Communist Manifesto, Principles of Communism, and Das Kapital. For most of his life he lived in England where he published his works and from where he became the most influential socialist of all time.

knut_wicksell;Knut Wicksell
knut_wicksell_desc;He was a Swedish economist whose work led to the widespread use of the word 'natural' to explain the long-run equilibrium rate of interest. Wicksell had a tremendous influence on economist James M. Buchanan. According to Buchanan, his theory of public choice 'was an almost natural consequence of my absorption of the Wicksellian message,' which stated that economists must cease acting as if government were a benevolent despot. Wicksell was a Malthusian and a strong advocate of birth control. He spoke out on moral issues quite often. He is best known for his work in 'Interest and Prices', in which he laid out his version of the quantity theory of money. His version was different from the standard view at that time in that he looked at the indirect effect that the money supply has on prices. Wicksell also elaborated on the theory of marginal productivity, which states that the payment to each factor of production equals that factors marginal productivity. He also stated that an efficient allocation of resources does not guarantee equitable distribution, because the preexisting distribution of income determines what form this allocation will take, and the preexisting distribution of income is not always just. The Stockholm School developed its own version of macroeconomics, which was based on Wicksell's work on quantity and price theory.

leon_walras;Leon Walras
leon_walras_desc;The French economist Leon Walras (pronounced 'Valrasse') has been hailed by Joseph Schumpeter as 'the greatest of all economists'. Walras was one of the three leaders of the Marginalist Revolution, even though his greatest work, Elements of Pure Economics, was published in 1874, three years after those of William Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger. Nonetheless, alone among the three revolutionaries, Leon Walras set forth the new 'marginalist' or 'Neoclassical' theory in a formal general equilibrium setting.   Thus, he endowed it with the multi-market considerations Jevons had largely avoided and the mathematical precision Menger had eschewed. Leon Walras is widely and rightfully regarded as the father of general equilibrium theory.

liberty_enlightening_the_world_desc;It has been almost 100 years since France, and General Lafayette, came to the aid of the brave, young American republic at the hour of her birth and most dire need. Since then, the American republic has served as an inspiration to freedom loving people everywhere, and has stood as a clear and voiceful reminder to the world of the possibilities of human liberty. Some within France's republican circles have suggested that we celebrate this centennial by presenting to the American people a suitable gift to mark their first hundred years as a free people, and their historical bonds of friendship with the French nation. Vive la Liberte!

ludwig_von_mises_desc;An Austrian economist who would challenge the growing influence of Keynesian economics upon the actions of the State in the 1930s. Von Mises argued that the attempt by the State to use its resources to revive demand in the economy created dangerous potentials for inflation of the economy and severe imbalances in the ability of the marketplace to find the balance between supply and demand that would ensure stable economic growth. Von Mises was also a sharp critic of socialist economic models, arguing that such models removed the ability of the market to determine price levels that would ensure adequate supply based on the demands of consumers for goods

The result would be a rapid expansion of the use of simple, direct means of advertising to popularize new products and increase the appeal and demand for established products would become permanent features of popular culture as the twentieth century evolved, and would eventually come to impact other realms of public life, including politics

military_aviation_desc;Military aviation is the use of aircraft and other flying machines for the purposes of conducting or enabling warfare. Heavier-than-air aircraft were recognized as having military applications early on. A Wright Model A was purchased in 1909 by the U.S. Army Signal Corps, and in 1911 the Italians used a variety of aircraft types in reconnaissance, photo-reconnaissance, and bombing roles as part of the Italo-Turkish War. World War I saw military aviation rapidly embrace many specialized types, such as scouts, artillery observers, fighters or bombers.

mixed_economy;Mixed Economy
mixed_economy_desc;As the twentieth century developed and the influence of alternative models of economic development outside the capitalist framework began to be implemented in certain societies, some politicians began to consider the possibility that merging what were considered the best elements from both capitalism and command economies could produce benefits for their society as a whole. As a result in some nations moves were made by the State to introduce elements of state direction into certain areas of economic activity while preserving the basic capitalist elements at the root of the economic system. While many more ideologically-driven critics of such policies argued the policies either went too far or not far enough in their transformations of the economy, the results of creating a mixed economic system in terms of both restoring economic production and reducing social tensions were often quite impressive.

national_radio_networks_desc;As the twentieth century evolved the role of wireless communication pioneered in the development of radio by Guglielmo Marconi would rapidly increase as technological changes improved the clarity and quality of radio transmissions. By the early 1920s the improvements would result in the development of a whole new medium of information exchange as radio frequencies could be used to transmit content designed to entertain, inform, or convince. Realizing the potential power of this new medium, states began to regulate the assigning of radio frequencies, with some establishing national monopolies while others allowed for the development of commercial broadcasting networks. By the early 1930s the radio set would become one of the most desired consumer goods, and its potential use to not only entertain but develop and shape public opinion would soon be seized upon by politicians and those who aspired to political power

naval_exercises_desc;A critical component of training for war at sea were naval exercises, in which ships would engage in mock-battles and other realistic training missions so as to understand how to act under wartime conditions.

A balanced fleet of both capital and escort ships was essential to victory in modern naval combat.

niederwald_denkmal_desc;The Niederwalddenkmal is a monument in the Niederwald park, Hesse, Germany. The monument's central figure is a ten meter high statue of Germania, the personification of the German nation, holding aloft the recovered Imperial crown of Germany, flanked by two statues representing War and Peace respectively. Built between 1871 and 1883, the monument was commissioned after the Franco-Prussian war, to commemorate the founding of the German Empire.

nihilism_and_the_will;Nihilism and The Will
nihilism_and_the_will_desc;The foundations for the trend away from the emphasis on human rationality in philosophy in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries would be established with a revival in the interest among some philosophers in nihilism, the rejection of the idea that the life of the individual has any meaning or purpose in the grand workings of the universe. In place of the self-value of the individual as a being, focus was placed on The Will, the human ability to intervene in a situation to his own benefit. Developed most effectively in the writings of Friedrich Nietzsche in the late nineteenth century, the dramatic impact of warfare in the industrial era would lead to further refinement of the concept by philosophers such as Martin Heidegger in the early twentieth century. In its denial of the value of absolutes as guides for the conduct of human behavior, Nihilism would help contribute to the further questioning, and for many the ultimate rejection, of the values and beliefs that had shaped the Victorian world, while the emphasis on Will would encourage action to challenge accepted practices and encourage the construction of new values

panama_canal_NEWS_LONG;The opening of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama offers a proud day for $TAG0_0$. The canal is 48 miles long, and is in fact a locked waterway 85 feet above sea level with some of the most intricate locks on both ends. It was built in one of the most unhealthy areas of the entire world, so it's as much a monument to modern engineering as to modern medicine. The canal is expected to quickly become an important conduit to international maritime commerce, experts also claim it to offer great strategic advantage to its controller in times of war.

paramilitary_groups_desc;As a result of the huge manpower requirements of militaries in an age of industrial warfare, the restoration of peace often resulted in the creation of large numbers of veterans, many of whom found it difficult to adjust to a return to civilian life and who possessed basic military training that could be put to use if needed. With the growth of revolutionary movements on the Left and particularly on the Right, the potential use of disgruntled military veterans for the purpose of challenging the actions and influence of ideological opponents grew rapidly. Their existence and growth in times of political, social and economic upheaval proved challenging to the ability of many States to maintain law and order, and the activities of such paramilitaries were often cited by those opposed to Liberal Capitalism of the inherent weakness of democracy in the face of revolutionary challenges that threatened the social order

The impact of this period was still to be felt in the American Civil War and the early phases of World War I. With the advent of cheap small arms and the rise of the drafted citizen soldier, armies grew rapidly in size to become massed formations. This necessitated dividing the army first into divisions and later into corps. Along with divisions came divisional artillery

priming_the_pump_;Priming The Pump 
priming_the_pump__desc;In wake of a series of economic shocks that shook the world in the first part of the twentieth century some politicians would become influenced by new economic theories regarding supply and demand and their interplay in times of economic crisis. Based upon the concept that money spent in the economy has a multiplier effect that increases economic activity by generating income that can contribute to new demand, some politicians made appeals in wake of economic declines for epriming the pumpe to reinflate demand and thus resume economic growth. Not all politicians and economist accepted this argument, and to some such state intervention appeared as an introduction of socialist principles into the economy, but the political impact of having the State appear to be actively trying to improve economic conditions made such political promises very appealing to those negatively impacted by economic downturns.

quantum_theory;Quantum Theory
quantum_theory_desc;The dramatic expansion of scientific knowledge in the nineteenth century would lead to a questioning of the rational model of the basic structures of the universe that had culminated in the work of Isaac Newton in the late seventeenth century. As scientific equipment became more precise, discrepancies in the models of atomic behavior as understood in the nineteenth century resulted in further research into the nature of atomic particles and their interaction with forces such as energy. As a result of the work of physicists such as Albert Einstein and Werner Heisenberg, the idea that the basic structures of the universe could be known with precision by humans was shown to be incorrect, and an alternative view that there were elements of unpredictability in the structure and behavior of atomic particles would be proposed. While a major step forward in human understanding of the basic structures of matter, the emphasis of the random nature of some elements of the natural world further shook the Victorian faith in the ability of humanity to understand fully the natural world and reinforced the sense that the world was indeed not built upon completely rational behavior and assumptions

The charismatic Garibaldi, vastly popular both at home and abroad, and generally seen as a freedom fighter, was instrumental in securing Italian Unification under the Sardinian Crown. These Italian Pan-Nationalists fight for the Unification of Italy.

REMOVE_EVTDESC1002;Anarcho-Liberals are campaigning on the streets: 'Instead of the state controlling the law enforcement, the courts and the national defence, the different law systems should be provided by voluntarily-founded private competitors. Money should be privately and competitively provided in an open market and personal and economic activities should be regulated by the natural laws of the market and through private law rather than through politics.'\n\nAnarcho-Liberals try to get their voices heard among the other politicians in the country.

REMOVE_EVTDESC11100;All around $COUNTRY$, jubilant crowds, waving the flag of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, take to the streets in celebration, as news reach us from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that $FROMRULER$ has proclaimed himself the liberator of all $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$.\n\n'For far too long have we let the machination and conspiracy of foreign powers set the course of our nation's life. Today, and forever -- here, in our ancient homeland -- we form the bonds of a more perfect union. Three Hurrahs for $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$!'\n\nResisting these winds of change will be nigh on impossible.
REMOVE_EVTDESC13100;The foreigners have gone too far! Their missionaries spread false teachings, subverting our people and our national unity, they break our customs and their opium clouds our minds. At least that is the message you will get if you ask the people in $PROVINCENAME$ where an anti-foreign revolt has just broken out.

REMOVE_EVTDESC14780;Natives of $PROVINCENAME$ seem to have caught measles. The coughing, the runny nose, high fever, red eyes and the red, itching rash which covers their whole bodies is a clear indication of measles.

REMOVE_EVTDESC14790;The man writhed in pain, his body covered in a red rash, his eyes rimmed with red and a cough which threatened to choke him.'\n\nResidents of a neighboring province to $PROVINCENAME$ have been infected with measles and it is now spreading to your colony.

REMOVE_EVTDESC14810;One of the way to stop the measles epidemic is to isolate all the infected, provide them with everything they will need, such as handkerchiefs, fluids and a couple of caretakers, preferably some of the colonists as they seem immune to the disease.

This morning the congressmen from the Southern states resigned their offices, and the slave states declared secession from the perpetual Union. A southern wind blows hard on our house divided.
REMOVE_EVTDESC16010;John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave, but his soul is marching on.'--John Brown's Body, Union Marching song\n\nThe famed hero of the abolitionist movement, the late John Brown, was hanged in $PROVINCENAME$ today after a failed raid on a military armory. Supposedly, Brown had planned to use the arsenal's weapons to arm slaves and incite an open slave rebellion across the entire south.

REMOVE_GC_DESC;The dust has settled on the fields of Waterloo, where the ideals of the French Revolution were believed to have met their final demise at the hands of the Ancien Regimes of Europe. After the tribulations of Napoleon's wars, the consensus established at the Congress of Vienna has restored a tentative calm to a troubled continent. While the flames of revolution may have been put out for now, the ideas of human liberty, nationalism and liberalism will soon prove themselves more alive than ever. In the Americas, those same ideas threaten to plunge a young republic into the devastation of a civil war. Princess Victoria is 16 years old, and will soon ascend to the throne of Great Britain, the greatest industrial empire ever to span the globe. Her ascension, to a long and prosperous reign, marks the beginning of an age that is to last all the way up until the First World War. In this new era of unprecedented technological progress, doubts will be cast on certainties that have stood since time immemorial, and new dogmas will rise in their place. Far away, across the briny foam, the riches of Asia and Africa, and The Heart of Darkness, beckon that their songs may also be heard, in the Concert of Europe. Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the music play.

repeal_the_corn_laws_desc;The 'Corn Laws' were a series of vastly unpopular tariffs, often described as a rare example of British mercantilism, designed to 'protect' British farmers and corn prices from cheap foreign competition, which, naturally, had the effect of effectively increasing corn prices for Britain's poor. After the failed harvest of 1845, and the following Potato Famine in Ireland, the Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846. The failure of these tariffs heralded a long period of British commitment to the ideals of Laissez-faire capitalism, that was to last for most of the 19th century.

richard_kahn_desc;An English economist who first developed the concept of the multiplier effect of spending in an economy in the early 1930s. At its base, this is the concept that spending in the economy for goods and services produced new potentials for demand by the providers of those initial goods and services, creating an expansion of demand beyond the initial value of the original spending. Adopted by John Maynard Keynes in his concept of the role of aggregate demand in the functioning of the economy, the concept of the multiplier effect would be increasingly adopted by States facing economic slowdowns by encouraging the State itself to increase its spending in the economy as a way to revive weakened demand and restore economic growth

robert_torrens_desc;Robert Torrens was a British army officer and owner of the influential Globe newspaper. Torrens was an independent discoverer of the Ricardo's principle of 'comparative advantage' in international trade (albeit a promoter of 'reciprocal tariffs', rather than unilateral free trade). Torrens was also a co-discoverer of the Ricardian theory of 'differential rent', although, in later editions, recanted the Malthusian population doctrine on which it was partly based.  Torrens remained a consistent critic of the 'labor theory of value'.

By operating deep inside Confederate territory, and by destroying much of Georgia's civilian infrastructure, Sherman is often said to have broken the South's will to fight. Apply his methods, and it might be the final nail in the Confederacy's coffin.

sidney_webb;Sidney Webb
sidney_webb_desc;Webb developed socialist ideas while at university and in 1885 he joined the Fabian Society. The society believed that capitalism had created an unjust and inefficient society. The members agreed that the ultimate aim of the group should be to reconstruct 'society in accordance with the highest moral possibilities'. The Fabian Society was a 'fact-finding and fact-dispensing body' and it produced a series of pamphlets on a wide variety of different social issues. Many of these were written by Sidney Webb including Facts for Socialists (1887), Facts for Londoners (1888) and The Eight Hour Day (1891). Webb also wrote A Plan on Campaign for Labour with George Bernard Shaw. Webb later became an important socialdemocratic figure with influence in the international worker organizations.

For the cultural elite, a stark choice was offered, either accept the limits of creativity imposed by the State in onees work, or face the retribution of the State for challenging its authority. In communist regimes this new artistic ethos came to be known as Socialist Realism, but fascist regimes had their own analogous stylistic ethos which was imposed from above

stanley_jevons;Stanley Jevons
stanley_jevons_desc;The impact of Jevons on economics can hardly be exaggerated.  As the father of Neoclassical economics, his legacy is secure.  However, in some ways, he stopped short of the mark.  Jevons could have gone further by connecting his insights in pure exchange into a wider theory incorporating production, capital, money and the business cycle in a more systematic and consistent manner that would have knocked the Ricardian School completely out of the picture.  Had he not died so young, Jevons might yet have done so, but the next economics treatise he was working on (published posthumously in 1905), did not really seem to go in that ambitious direction.  As such, by the time of his death, the Marginalist Revolution was still in its insurrectionist phase.  It was still a tentative proposition rather than a firmly-set and integrated system, a scientific hypothesis but not quite yet a science. It should be noted that Jevons made maybe as much for the subject of Logics as for economics, which is quite a feat.

The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century.

tanzimat_reforms_desc;Tanzimat' Turkish for 'reorganization' was a series of reforms enacted by the Ottoman state during the latter half of the 19th century, designed to counteract the rising tides of nationalism among the Empire's vast and varied ethnic minorities. The reforms aimed at integrating the various populations under the common banner of 'Ottomanism', by promoting the Ottoman state as an alternative to the ethnicity based nation states that many of the radicalized minorities within the state were, at the time, seeking to establish, and by granting increased representation and autonomy within the state. While the Tanzimat was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the decline of the Ottoman state, it can nevertheless be argued that the reforms at least postponed it.

Telephone exchanges consisted of hundreds of 'plug boards' where a staff of operators manually 'plugged in' calls to route them. Almon Brown Strowger patented the first stepping switch in 1891, which led to automated telephone switching.

the_case_of_edgardo_mortara_desc;Edgardo Mortara was born to Jewish parents in Bologna in 1851. During a period of illness in 1857, a Catholic servant girl of the Mortara family baptized Edgardo, for fear that he might otherwise, as a non-christian, go to Hell if he died. On the basis of this baptism, the Papal States' police took Edgardo away from his family, and had him raised as a Roman Catholic, as non-christians were, according to Papal States' law, forbidden to raise Christian children, even their own. The case, or kidnapping, caused an international uproar, and was protested by, among others, Napoleon III, Emperor Franz Josef and The London Times. Mortara himself would go on to become a Catholic priest, and resumed contact with his siblings and mother in his later life.

the_decline_of_the_west_and_the_lost_generation_desc;The combination of the dramatic social, economic and political transformations undertaken in the nineteenth century with the rise of industry and the devastation produced by mass warfare in the industrial age created a crisis of confidence among many intellectuals that the whole structure of society was under siege and in danger of complete collapse. Oswald Spengler began work on eThe Decline Of The Weste in 1911 as the challenges of new social, political and economic forces were shaking advanced industrial societies to their cores, with Spengler concluding that what these societies were experiencing was part of the natural cycle of civilizations that rise, have a period of brilliance, and eventually decline and collapse e a direct challenge to the Victorian idea that modern industrial society could continually be improved as a result of humanityes rational abilities. Coined by American author Gertrude Stein, eThe Lost Generatione captured the sense of loss and emptiness that many veterans of Great War felt after surviving the carnage of the battlefields and questioning the values and beliefs that had encouraged their nations to participate in the conflicts in the first place. These themes of decline and loss that Spengler and Woolf developed would dominate the cultural landscape in the early twentieth century.
the_doctrine_of_fascism;The Doctrine Of Fascism
the_doctrine_of_fascism_desc;The spread of revolutionary Communism in the early twentieth century as a potential alternative model to Liberal Capitalism as the basis of the organization of society would lead to the development of new models on the political Right that sought to offer a third alternative that would replace the weaknesses inherent in Liberal Capitalist systems without promoting a social revolution that would dispossess the power and status of the upper and middle classes. By the early 1920s such a model would crystallize in the evolution of Fascism. Although less rigorously defined in terms of ideological content than Communism, Fascism at its base called for the reorganization of The State for the benefit of The Nation as a whole, so that all who are defined as members of the national community, regardless of socioeconomic class, receive the benefits of modern industrial society. This would be achieved by subsuming the desires and concerns of the individual to the needs of the Nation under the leadership of a single party that would govern according to the needs of the Nation as a whole and prepare the Nation to compete successfully with other nations for power and influence in the world. Fully elaborated in the writings of the Italian Giovanni Gentile in the early 1930s, Fascism as an alternative to both Liberal Capitalism and Communism would grow rapidly in the early twentieth century.
the_first_vatican_council_desc;In 1868, Pope Piux IX convened the 20th ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church. The council was convened to address the perceived problems of the modern ideologies of liberalism, rationalism and materialism, as well as to further define Catholic dogma. While the council was cut short by the capture of Rome by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, it still left a lasting impression on Catholic theology in the form of the formalized Dogma of Papal Infallibility.

the_meiji_restoration_desc;Japan is traditionally considered to have been founded by Emperor Jimmu in 660 B.C., and while the Imperial Lineage was still considered unbroken since then, the Imperial Office had, throughout the Edo period, been reduced to a revered and respected but, ultimately, politically powerless institution. By embracing a restoration of Imperial Rule, along with a programme of swift industrial modernization, constitutionalism and economic freedom, Japan might be able to break the fetters placed upon her by the impositions of the Western World.
the_meiji_restoration_NEWS_LONG; The penetration of western influences in Japan has culminated in the overthrow of the feudal system which has governed the islands for hundreds of years, and the restoration of the Emperor to power in Tokyo. A new era of social, political and economic reforms was declared on Wednesday as the Shogun relinquished his power and the Meiji (enlightened rule) era was declared. A bright future surely awaits the land of the rising sun under the new enlightened administration, though some have voiced fears the new Japan could eventually challenge European interests in Asia.

the_revolt_of_the_masses_desc;The move towards the establishment of universal suffrage as the basis for determining the balance of political power in society led to an increased sense of hope that with democracy the issues and concerns of The People would finally be addressed. The resulting factionalism caused by the growth of political parties in wake of universal suffrage soon exposed the limitations of liberal democracy as a system for the arbitration of power in society (especially in times of social, economic or political crisis) and led to a great deal of disenchantment with the ideals of democracy as the best system of governance and a search for potential alternatives to more effectively achieve the promises of a better life for all. Written in 1930 by the Spanish intellectual Jose Ortega y Gasset, eThe Revolt Of The Massese warns of the potential threat to the ideal of liberal democracy in its current limitations and the potential for the masses to overwhelm the political system and replace it with alternatives that in the end would destroy the basic principles of classic liberal democracy unless liberal democracy was able to reform itself to meet the challenges produced by mass politics.

the_talkies_desc;The development of the cinema in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century would result in the creation of a new mass cultural activity that would soon become one of the hallmarks of the era. The power and influence of the cinema would be further enhanced when in the 1920s technological improvements allowed for the ability of sounds to be synchronized with the moving images so that not just the visual representation of a scene could be represented on screen, but its aural component as well. eThe Jazz Singer,e released in the United States in 1927, was the first sound motion picture, and within half a decade the silent movie had become a relic of the past, and a new, powerful medium had entered the public sphere, forever changing not only popular culture, but the nature of politics and international relations as well

thorstein_veblen;Thorstein Veblen
thorstein_veblen_desc;Thorstein Veblen is to economics what Jonathan Swift is to English literature: a master of the art of satire. It is essential to effective satire that its message be ambiguous: the reader should never be sure whether the author is absolutely serious or just pulling his or her leg. That quality is certainly present in Swift's Gulliver's Travels and it is also present in Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class (1899), The Instinct of Workmanship (1914), Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution (1915), The Higher Learning in America (1918), Absentee Ownership (1923), and his many essays. In fact, it is there in everything he wrote except The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), which is as near as he ever came to writing a conventional academic book. No matter which of these books we open, we find the idea that life in a modern industrial community is the result of a polar conflict between 'pecuniary employments' and 'industrial employments', between 'business enterprise' and 'the machine process', between 'vendibility' and 'serviceability'-in short, between making money and making goods. There is a class struggle under capitalism, not between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but between businessmen and engineers. Pecuniary habits of thought unite bankers, brokers, lawyers and managers in a defence of private acquisition

The gardens were built in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and functioned as a place of residence for the Qing Emperors. The Old Summer Palace was burnt to the ground by Anglo-French forces during their occupation of Beijing during the Second Opium War. While the torching was a major blow to Chinese morale, it was also decried by many European intellectuals, Victor Hugo among others, as a criminal act of brutality directed against the Chinese. By burning this exquisite piece of Chinese cultural history, we can inflict a massive blow on Chinese morale.

tulls_seed_drill;Tull's Seed Drill
tulls_seed_drill_desc;Up until this era, farmers planted the seeds for cereal crops by carrying the seeds in a bag and walking up and down the field throwing or broadcasting the seed. They broadcast the seed by hand on to the ploughed and harrowed ground. The problem with this method was that it did not give a very even distribution. It was not, therefore, an efficient use of the seed and much of it was wasted. Jethro Tull invented a Seed Drill which could be pulled behind a horse. It consisted of a wheeled vehicle containing a box filled with grain. There was a wheel-driven ratchet that sprayed the seed out evenly as the Seed Drill was pulled across the field.

tut_1a_1;The Military
tut_1a_10;The supply status of your army. Each army needs certain items to function properly, these items will be automatically collected form your stockpile.\nIf you fail to provide these items this will negatively influence reinforcement rate and the rate at which organization is regained.
tut_1a_11;Take a moment and hover your mouse over the icons in the unit view to gain more information.
tut_1a_12;Splitting
tut_1a_13;To keep the Dutch occupied we should send some units to the border. We shouldn't leave the capital undefended however so we should split our army.
tut_1a_14;Splitting
tut_1a_15;A new army has now been created and you can see the reorganization interface. To fill the army with units, move the subunits you want by clicking the marked buttons. Try moving one unit over to the new Army.
tut_1a_15a;Please click the split army icon.
tut_1a_16;Merging
tut_1a_17;Well done, Brussels should now have 2 armies. You can also notice the small flag next to the waving Belgian flag next to your armies. This indicates that there is more than one army here.
tut_1a_17a;However, the Dutch are probably going to run over this army, we should rejoin it. First select both units in the province by dragging a box around them. If you select any units outside the province of Brussels, just press Escape on your keyboard and try again.
tut_1a_18;After selecting the units, press the Merge button.
tut_1a_2;Welcome to the tutorial covering the military aspect of Victoria 2.\nYou are in command of Belgium, a small nation with great potential. There is a problem however, your Dutch neighbors have just declared war.
tut_1a_20;Moving a unit
tut_1a_21;Now we need to march against the vile Dutch. We want to move our army in Brussels to take on the Dutch army in Maastricht. Select the army in Brussels and then right click Maastricht to move your army there.
tut_1a_22;Moving a unit
tut_1a_22b;Moving a unit
tut_1a_22c;Your unit is now on the move, notice how the arrow is filling up.
tut_1a_23;Notice the arrow that starts at your unit and points to Maastricht. As your unit progress this arrow will start to fill indicating how far your army has marched.\nUnpause the game by pressing space on your keyboard.
tut_1a_24;The battle
tut_1a_25;Your units are now in action against the Dutch. Notice the progress bar that appeared under your unit, this indicates who are winning. More red indicates that the nation flag to the left is winning, more green indicates that the nation to the right is winning.\nClick the progress bar to get more details on the battle.
tut_1a_26;The battle
tut_1a_27;The combat view should now have appeared, here you can get more detailed information on what happens in the battle.\nAgain, press space to unpause the game. We should win this battle in a short while.
tut_1a_28;The battle
tut_1a_29;The battle is over, your army should have won. In the combat result screen you can see the results of the action. Click next to continue.
tut_1a_3;Selecting a Unit
tut_1a_30;The Outliner
tut_1a_31;Clicking the map is not the only way to select a unit. Victoria 2 has a feature called the outliner. Click the little plus sign to the right to open the outliner.
tut_1a_32;The Outliner
tut_1a_33;The outliner is a shortcut to various useful things in your country such as armies, battles and ongoing constructions. You can configure the outline by selecting and unselecting the small icons at the top of it.
tut_1a_33a;Right now we want the 3eme Division, click this unit in the outliner.
tut_1a_34;Transporting units by sea
tut_1a_35;To surprise the Dutch we are going land troops behind their line. Make sure you have the army in Bruges selected. Notice that you have a fleet in the Bruges port (there is a ship next to the dock).
tut_1a_35a;By clicking the Load button in the interface, load your units onto the ships.
tut_1a_36;Transporting units by sea
tut_1a_37;Now we must move our fleet to the sea province 'Dogger Bank'. Do this by clicking the port in Bruges and, after the fleet is selected, right clicking on the coast of Holland. After your movement arrow has appeared, unpause the game.
tut_1a_38;Transporting units by sea
tut_1a_39;Now we must land. Ensure that you still have your navy selected. Notice the button in the lower right corner of the unit view, clicking this will select your army. Click this and move your unit into Middelburg by right clicking the province.
tut_1a_40;After you see the movement arrow, unpause the game to get going.
tut_1a_5;The Unit View
tut_1a_6;The army you just selected, the 1e Infanterie Divisie, consists of 12000 men in 4 brigades. You can see the individual brigades and number of men in the unit view.\n In the unit view you can also find the following values:
tut_1a_7;The number of men and brigades. If you go into combat the number of men will decrease, if you have unemployed soldiers in your country however it will automatically recover.
tut_1a_8;The leader of your army, whose personality will affect the army performance.
tut_1a_9;Strength and organization. The green (left) bar is organization, this represents the combat readiness of your units. The higher the value the more effective your unit will fight. Organization is lost in combat but will be regained automatically. The red (right) bar represents strength. When the bar is full your unit has it's maximum strength, if not it has taken losses that have not yet been replaced.
tut_1b_19;For now we are manually going to assign our General, go ahead and select your division in Spa.
tut_1c_9;As we said before, should a pop with soldiers attached to it rebel the brigades will rebel with it. If a brigade has a rebel faction icon next to its population icon, this means that it's POP is a member of a faction. This is very dangerous. One way to check the status of this pop and what its issues are is to click the pop icon in the unit view to open the Population view. For now, just click Next to continue.
tut_2a_1;Industry
tut_2a_2;Welcome to the tutorial covering the industrial aspect of Victoria 2. Here we will learn about the most basic component in building your country in Victoria 2, the Economy.
tut_2a_2a;The economy is built around money and trade goods. Trade goods are produced and consumed by people and armies while money is used to fuel the transfer of goods from the producers to the consumers.
tut_2a_2b;To get an overview of the goods produced in your country, press the production tab in the top bar.
tut_2a_2c;Production
tut_2a_2d;One of the fundamental driving factors in Victoria 2 is the movement of Goods, goods being everything from Lumber to Small Arms. Goods are produced by producers and bought by consumers. The consumers are either people needing something to eat or producers needing raw materials.
tut_2a_2e;Most of this transfer of goods will take place without you, you interaction with this process is building factories, taxing the income of trade and buying the goods you need to fund your armies.
tut_2a_2f;Click next to Continue.
tut_2a_3;Production
tut_2a_4;Goods are produced from 3 sources.
tut_2a_4b;RGOs - These are farms and mines where farmers and labourers harvest the bounties of nature.
tut_2a_4c;Artisans - The the blacksmiths and weavers. They buy goods off the market and manufacture refined goods.
tut_2a_4d;Factories - Factories also produce refined goods, these however are the way of the future. They are buildings built by the players or by capitalists, depending on political system, and employs craftsmen and clerks to do it.
tut_2a_5;Production Screen
tut_2a_6;In this screen you can see all the goods produced by your nation, they are grouped by category.\nEach output goods has an icon next to it representing which production type of producers produce it:
tut_2a_6a;Farmers/Labourers for RGOs.
tut_2a_6b;Craftsmen for factories.
tut_2a_6c;Artisans for their part of the production.
tut_2a_6d;In this screen you can hover your mouse over various icons to get a better idea about the production going on in your nation to help you make your decisions.
tut_3a_1;Budget
tut_3a_10;Secondly there are expenses that can be affected from the budget via sliders, the further right you pull the sliders the more it will cost you.
tut_3a_11;Most of the time you will have to prioritize. Do you need more troops? Increase the military budget. Do you need to expand the bureaucracy? Pull the Administration slider.\nTry pulling the sliders and see the numbers change, notice however that all changes are gradual, if you increase the administrative sliders more people will want to become bureaucrats over time.\nWhen you are done, click Next.
tut_3a_18;Balance your budget
tut_3a_19;Belgium needs a balanced budget. You achieve this by matching expenses and income. For every slider you pull there is a trade off however, higher taxes will cost your people, lower expenses will hurt your governments finances.
tut_3a_19a;If your budget is not balanced and our available money runs out, we will automatically take a loan. For now let's try to balance your budget. When you feel happy with it, click next.
tut_3a_2;Your nation, in this case the nation of Belgium, must manage its state budget to get ahead in the world, taxes must be balanced against expenses and money saved for investing into things like troops. To manage our budget we must open the budget screen, click the budget button in the top bar.
tut_3a_20;Loans
tut_3a_21;When your economy needs a short term boost you can always borrow money. These money comes from pops that have a surplus and store these money in the national bank.
tut_3a_21a;When you take a loan the money will first come from your own pops and then from pops in other nations.
tut_3a_22;Loans
tut_3a_23;You have now taken a loan. You can see the your total debt has increased by the amount you borrowed. Also note the interest value, this will be your daily interest payment on your loan.\nInterest is expensive however, so we should now pay back our loans. Press the Repay loan button and then pull the slider all the way to the right before you press OK
tut_3a_3;Budget screen
tut_3a_4;This is the budget screen. Here you can manage the expenses and income of your government as well as take loans to quickly raise cash. Let's start with taxation, click next to continue.
tut_3a_5;Taxes
tut_3a_6;Your most important means of getting revenue is through taxation. Taxes can be set differently for different strata of society.
tut_3a_6a;There are 3 different strata:
tut_3a_6b;Poor.
tut_3a_6c;Middle.
tut_3a_6d;Rich.
tut_3a_6e;Different professions belong to different strata, you can see which through the icons next to each tax slider.
tut_3a_6f;Taxes are set by pulling the slider that correspond to each strata. Taxes are however not without consequences, the more you tax the less money you leave your population with. Next to the tax slider you see a pie chart showing how well the needs of this strata are fulfilled.\nTry to set your tax as low as possible while maintaining a positive balance. Then click next to continue.
tut_3a_7;Expenses
tut_3a_8;So what do we do with our taxes? First of all we use it to pay for running our government. There are several types of expenditure such as the military budget and education budget as well as the costs for supplying your armies and colonies.
tut_3a_9;There are two kinds of expenses. The first one is fixed expenses depending on goods you buy such as military maintenance, these kind of expenses change based on action you do in other parts of the game such as disbanding an army.
tut_4a_1;Technology
tut_4a_10;Notice that the square in the lower right hand corner changed. In this square you can see the effects your technology will have when completed as well as inventions that can spawn. Start your project by clicking Start Research.
tut_4a_11;Starting Research
tut_4a_12;Now the selected tech should have turned blue, this means that the project is ongoing. You can always change the project you are researching by starting another.
tut_4a_2;To move forward in the world you need technology. Technology improves everything from your army to your industry. To manage technology, open the technology screen.
tut_4a_3;The Technology Screen
tut_4a_4;This is the technology screen, from here you can start the research of your technology. Technology is divided into 5 types, these are Army, Navy, Commerce, Culture and Industry. Belgium is a budding industrial power, let's click industry.
tut_4a_7;Selecting Research
tut_4a_8;You are now presented with all industrial technologies. The green ones are ones you already have, the yellow ones are those you can research and the grey ones are not available yet.
tut_4a_8a;In our quest to become an industrial powerhouse, we should try improving our Infrastructure. Click Experimental Railroad.
tut_4a_9;Starting Research
tut_5a_1;Politics
tut_5a_10;You should consider instituting reforms that your population wants but you must take care so that you can afford them. There is also the Upper House to consider, which might take issue with new reforms being enacted.\nBelow are a couple of examples of reforms Belgium currently has:
tut_5a_11;Voting System - Belgium has wealth voting. This means that only the rich and the middle strata are allowed to vote, if you would for example change to weighted wealth the same strata would be allowed to vote but with rich pops counted twice.
tut_5a_11a;Health Care - Belgium has 'Trinket Health Care'. This means that, at a cost, our population growth will increase by an extra 2.5%, but only if we fully fund the social reforms in the budget screen.
tut_5a_12;Issues and Voters
tut_5a_13;Here you can see how your people feel about things in your country. Notice the two pie charts, Voter Ideologies and People Ideologies. The difference between these is due to our voting system which is a political reform.
tut_5a_13a;An effect of this difference can be that while a party may win an election a majority of our people can get upset about this.
tut_5a_13b;Below you see the issues most important to your people and your voters, this can be an important factor to consider when implementing reforms.
tut_5a_2;This tutorial will cover the political aspects of Victoria 2. Politics is one of the more important features in Victoria 2. As the game progresses and society changes, new political ideas will take root in your population and your people will start to demand reforms.
tut_5a_2a;Political parties and reforms have a major impact on how you can control your country, and it's up to you how you want to manage the demands of your people.\nTo find out more about politics, click the Politics button in the top bar.
tut_5a_3;The Political Screen
tut_5a_4;In this screen you can see the current ruling party of your nation, the political leanings of your people and voters, and their issues. You can also change the ruling party if your government type allows, or start an election if you are democratically inclined. Press next to continue.
tut_5a_5;The Government
tut_5a_6;Here you can see the ruling party of your country. A ruling party has an ideology and a number of policies. These policies impose rules for how your country behaves, such as if the state can build factories or if only the capitalists do, and they also put limitations on the sliders in the budget screen.
tut_5a_6a;Belgium is ruled by the Katholieke Partij, you can find out more about their issues by hovering your mouse over each one. As the game progresses your needs will change, as will your people's ideologies, and the issues they support. You will have to balance the type of government you want with the one your population wants. Press next when you are ready to continue.
tut_5a_7;Reforms
tut_5a_8;To influence how your country works you can institute a number of political and social reforms.
tut_5a_9;Political reforms are things that affect the political system in your country while social reforms will divert government money to help various groups in the population.
tut_5b_12b;Click on the decisions tab to continue.
tut_5b_14b;Click on the movements tab to continue.
tut_6a_1;People
tut_6a_10;Colonization - Construct a colony in this state. This is the only focus relevant in an empty state.
tut_6a_11;Promotion - Encourage your people to promote to a certain profession.
tut_6a_12;Production - Encourage capitalists and artisans to build a certain kind of goods.
tut_6a_13;To improve Belgium's industrial production we need more industrial workers, click the craftsmen icon to set this focus.
tut_6a_14;The People
tut_6a_15;In the province view you can also see statistics about your population. In the 3 pie charts you can see, from left to right, what they work with, what their ideology is and which culture they belong to.
tut_6a_15a;This is not so much information however, if you click the View Pop statistics button next to the pie chart you can get more information about your people. Do this now.
tut_6a_16;The Pop View
tut_6a_17;This is the Population View. Here you can have all information about the people of Belgium. You can see that by entering via the province of Brussels this province has been preselected. First let us take a closer look at the composition of Brussels. By selecting another province, state or your entire nation you can get information about a different segment of your people.
tut_6a_18;In the top of the screen you have a number of filter buttons that let you filter out people of certain professions.
tut_6a_19;There is also a lot of statistics that about your current selection, such as what the people work with, their culture and religion.
tut_6a_2;Your people are your most important resources, and are basically the driving engine of Victoria 2. Your people will build goods, buy goods, pay taxes, vote, or even revolt if they are unhappy.
tut_6a_20;You also have a fairly long list of people in your province, divided into units that share profession, culture and religion, so called Pops. To find out a little more about one of our pops. Find the Flemish craftsman in the list to the left and click his icon.
tut_6a_21;The Pop
tut_6a_22;The basic unit of population is the pop which are simply a collection of people with same same culture, religion and profession. In this screen you can check how your population feels about things like issues and how angry they are. It pays to come back to this screen to check up on how different groups of your population are reacting to your policies, they might try do seek new jobs, migrate to other countries or revolt.\nClick next to continue.
tut_6a_2a;Your main source of information about your people comes from the pop view. But first, let's say something about where your people live, the provinces and the states.
tut_6a_2b;Go ahead and click the province of Brussels on your map in the center of the screen.
tut_6a_3;The Province and the State
tut_6a_4;The map is divided into provinces, the province is the smallest geographical unit in the game. It is here that your pops live and work.\nThe provinces in turn are divided into states. A state can be anything from one to four or more provinces.
tut_6a_4a;The state has a certain number of things it shares with all its provinces such as factories that build goods, bureaucrats that collect taxes and capitalists and aristocrats that exploit the workers.
tut_6a_4b;At the top of the province view that was opened when you selected the province, you see the name the state ('Vlaandern') and below it the name of the province.\nIn Victoria 2 most things that happen to your people are indirect effects of actions you take, there is however one thing you can do to more directly influence what goes on in a province, National Focus.
tut_6a_5;To access National Focus, press the national focus icon in the province view.
tut_6a_6;National Focus
tut_6a_7;National Focus is one of your most potent ways of influencing your population through a number of indirect effects on a state wide level.
tut_6a_8;Rail roads - Encourage your capitalists to build rail roads
tut_6a_9;Immigration - Encourage your people to move to this province.
tut_6b_14;Now click next to contiune.
tut_7a_1;Trade
tut_7a_12;Your Stockpile
tut_7a_13;Now turn your eyes towards the Stockpile. Here you can see how much of each trade good your government has in store and also how this has changed in the last day. Also note this button. Checking this will allow people in your common market to buy things from your stockpile. This could be useful if you cannot buy things abroad during war but have prepared for this by stockpiling strategic goods.
tut_7a_15;Now unpause the game for a few days and notice how our stockpile is filling up with Small Arms.
tut_7a_2;In Victoria 2 goods are produced from various sources such as RGOs, factories and artisans, these goods are then traded for money. Most of this trade happens automatically between the pops and the factories themselves. Some of it is done by the player, such as buying goods to build and supply armies, building factories and supporting overseas possessions. This is controlled via the trade screen. Go ahead and click the trade button in the top bar
tut_7a_3;The Trade screen
tut_7a_4;This is the trade screen, here you can find lots of information about the movement of goods on the market.\nIn the top left side of the screen you can see all the various goods available, together with their price and the latest price movement. We want some information about small arms, go ahead and click the Small Arms Icon
tut_7a_5;The Trade goods
tut_7a_6;Notice how the square in the upper right part of the screen changed to show the details of your goods.
tut_7a_6a;At the top you see the price curve showing how the price has developed over time.
tut_7a_6c;Here you can also see how much your country produces as well as the needs of your government, producers in your country and your pops.\nNow we need to buy some things. Press next to continue.
tut_7a_7;Setting up Trades
tut_7a_8;The Dutch are looking menacing, we should stockpile some guns for future use, guns are needed to build and supply armies.
tut_7a_8b;If you on the other hand click the icon over BUY it changes to SELL and you will instead sell from your stockpile until the stockpile reaches the value you set. For now we want to buy things, make sure the BUY/SELL is set to BUY and pull the slider to around 10 units and press Confirm Trade to confirm your new buy order.
tut_7b_6;The prices are set globally each day on the World Market as a function of supply and demand. The current supply and demand will set a target price which the actual price will gradually close in on, you should keep an eye on the development of prices on goods that are important to you. Are Small Arms going up, perhaps its time to build a new factory. The arrow next to the price indicates whether prices are rising (green), remaining steady (yellow) or falling (red). Click 'Next' to continue
tut_7b_8;The image below illustrates the world market entry for clipper convoys. The icons in the bottom row indicate whether we are currently selling or buying the good, and whether trading is currently set to AI automation or not. The government (the player or the AI) can buy and sell on the market in two ways, either by setting trade orders or by automatic trades generated through other actions in the game. Click the Icon for Clipper Convoys to see an automatic Trade.
tut_8a_1;Diplomacy
tut_8a_10;Declare War
tut_8a_11;When you declare war you must set a goal for your war. This is our stated reason for going to war and in peace negotiations we are limited to demanding the things we have stated as war goals. We can add more war goals if the war goes well for us, but if we fail to reach our goals our population will become angry with us.\nFor now we just want to humiliate the Dutch, this war goal means that if we win we can cut down their prestige a bit. Go ahead and press the humiliate button.
tut_8a_12;Declare War
tut_8a_13;Declaring war has a cost, the cost is in how the rest of the world sees us. This is called infamy, incurring high infamy can create many problems such as making nations form coalitions to stop our warmongering ways.
tut_8a_14;Wars also have their rewards. Besides the reward for completing war goals (you can see in the screen that we will cut Dutch prestige if we win) you also get prestige. Depending on which war goal you choose you get more or less prestige.
tut_8a_15;Each war goal also has a peace cost, the higher this cost the more your need to achieve in the war to convince the enemy to agree.
tut_8a_16;Now we are ready to declare war, press OK in the Declare War dialogue
tut_8a_2;Diplomacy is your most important tool to dominate the world in Victoria 2. Here you make alliances and declare war. You pull smaller countries into your sphere of influence and monitor your place among the Great Powers.\nClick the Diplomacy button in the top bar
tut_8a_3;The Diplomacy View
tut_8a_3a;This is the Diplomacy View. From here you control the diplomatic decisions of your nation and also keep an eye on other nations.
tut_8a_3b;The first thing we need to do is take action against our rivals in the north. The Netherlands are a bit stronger than us though, so we need allies. The British are a good candidate, try to find them in the list of countries in the lower left. To help you find it you can try to use the filter buttons over the list.
tut_8a_4a;Country Information
tut_8a_4b;We have now selected the The United Kingdom. First we need to know if they even like us before we can ally with them. Check out the value to the right in the list item that you just clicked. The value is a bit low but it might do. Now let us check out if they are involved in any other conflicts currently, go ahead and click the Show Wars button in the upper part of the screen.
tut_8a_5;Country Information
tut_8a_6;In this screen we should be able to see all the current wars in the upper right part. You should be able to see the Texan struggle against their former Mexican overlords. You can also check out The United Kingdom's Allies and Wars to the center right as well as some data telling us about their capability to fight a war.
tut_8a_7;To try to ally with The United Kingdom we need to take a diplomatic action. Diplomatic actions can be anything from requesting an alliance to declaring war. To perform a diplomatic action we need to have diplomatic points, which are accumulated monthly. Looking in the top bar under diplomacy we can see that we have a few points, more than the 1 point that the Form Alliance action costs. Go ahead and press the Form Alliance action and then press the 'Accept' button to suggest an alliance with the UK.
tut_8a_8;Declare War
tut_8a_9;Now The United Kingdom should be our ally. Usually we might need to wait a bit for the answer but this time the Foreign Office was quick. Now let's do something about the Dutch. Select the Netherlands in the list and click the Declare War button.
tut_8c_12;In Victoria 2 you must set a War Goal for any war you start. You can only select the War goals you can see on the right side of the War Declaration Pop-up. Be aware that these War goals are the only thing you can demand in peace. \n Click the Show Wars view to check out wargoals.

vacuum_tube_desc;The vacuum tube (also known as the thermionic valve) is a device that utilizes the flow of current through a vacuum. In a vacuum tube electrons travel via thermionic emission (the Edison Effect) from a hot filament (negative cathode) through the vacuum to a positive electrode (the anode). Additional electrodes were later interposed between the anode and cathode, enabling amplification and switching of signals. Vacuum tubes were essential to the production and commercialization of radio, telephones, TV, radar, and early computers

vangaurd_party_desc;As the Socialist movement grew in influence in some industrial nations, in other societies that were less industrialized the idea that the working class could lead an overthrow of the State and seize power was realized to be limited. Coined by the Russian socialist Vladimir Lenin in 1902, the concept of the vanguard party was that a small group of dedicated revolutionaries could lead the struggle for revolution in the name of the masses who lacked the ability or desire to carry out revolution themselves and, having achieved power in their name, establish control over the State and carry out the transformations necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of the socialist movement, the workeres utopia. While most influential within Leftist political circles in the early twentieth century, the concept of an ideological vanguard seizing power on behalf of groups in society as a whole would also be influential on the Right as ultra-nationalist movements began to move towards a more concrete ideological system, Fascism

war_gamming;War Gaming
war_gamming_desc;The use of war games to plan and prepare for war is as old as warfare itself, and includes such hallmarks as chess. However, serious analytical naval war gaming emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Major naval powers would use detailed gaming systems that took account of such variables as a ship's armour, speed, and the number and caliber of guns in order to determine battle damage and the ultimate victor. These naval war games were used to test strategic plans, and different means of countering potential enemy strategies and warships.

If we are to remain what we always have been, and not become something else entirely, now is the time to assume control of our own destiny. It has become apparent to the leading members of our intellectual elite, that the only way to turn the tide on the Western Leviathan is to swim with it, for, as Sun Tzu says: The reed that bends before the wind, also offers a form of resistance.

wilhelm_roscher;Wilhelm Roscher
wilhelm_roscher_desc;A professor at the Univ. of Leipzig (1848-94), he was a founder of the German historical school of economics, which rejected the classical laissez-faire view. Roscher's work emphasized the developmental character of capitalism through detailed historical analyses of the cultures of ancient nations. His System der Volkswirtschaft (5 vol., 1854-94, tr. of 13th ed., Principles of Political Economy, 1878) was an influential textbook in the second half of the 19th cent. His most significant work is Geschichte der National-oekonomik in Deutschland (1874).

william_cunningham;William Cunningham
william_cunningham_desc;Cunningham was a vocal opponent of the nascent Neoclassical economics, particularly as propounded by his colleague, Alfred Marshall and the Cambridge School.  In economics, he sought to promote the historical method, making him one of the most leading advocates of the English Historical School.  Despite the sustained attacks levied by Cunningham, Marshall was sufficiently influenced by his pleas to try to include some more historical content in his work and operate more 'inductively' in the derivation of his economic principles.  However, he refused to accept Cunningham's main charge -- that the validity of economic laws is conditional on historical, social and cultural context. Cunningham's opposition to Neoclassicism was not only one of method, but also of politics.  Cunningham was deeply opposed to utilitarian philosophy and laissez-faire politics, and penned several tracts defending labor unions and protectionism.  He also resurrected much interest in old Mercantilist thought.

wireless;Wireless
wireless_desc;An important development in naval warfare in the early-20th century was the wireless, or radio communications. This allowed naval headquarters to communicate with fleets at sea in order to give updated orders, and also allowed admirals to communicate much more effectively with individual warships in their fleets, in comparison with older methods such as signal flags. However, one drawback of wireless was that it was also possible for the enemy to listen in on wireless communications, and soon the major navies would establish organizations to glean valuable intelligence from enemy communications.
